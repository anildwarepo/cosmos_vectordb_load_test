country: Italy.
description: Always the firm's showstopper and one of the best expressions of this celebrated vineyard, the 2013 doesn't disappoint. It opens with alluring scents of wild red berry, Alpine herb, truffle, graphite and new leather while the dazzling palate boasts Marasca cherry, clove, cinnamon, tobacco and a balsamic note. It already shows remarkable finesse and complexity but still needs years to develop to its full and impressive potential. Drink from 2025 through 2050..
