country: US.
description: The Indian Wells Cabernet Sauvignon seems a little reductive at the moment; odd, since the 2005 vintage was forward, almost fat, and the wine has been in bottle for quite some time. It should definitely be decanted and aired out before serving, which will help to push the fruit flavors forward. The finish is just slightly dilute, but the wine is well-made and may just be suffering from some of the occasional dumbness that strikes Cabernet..
