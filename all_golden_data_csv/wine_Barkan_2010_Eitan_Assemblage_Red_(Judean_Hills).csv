wine_Barkan_2010_Eitan_Assemblage_Red_(Judean_Hills),"Unnamed: 0: 48805.
country: Israel.
description: This is a dark, dense blend of 52% Syrah, 30% Merlot and 18% Cabernet Sauvignon. Aromas of cassis, blackberry and plum lead on the bouquet, with background accents of tree bark and forest floor. The firm structure and gripping tannins are softened by ripe black-fruit flavors that carry through to the lingering finish. Balanced but young, this should develop greater complexity and nuance with time; drink 2016â€“2020..
