title: The Dove and the Ant.
text: A dove came to a brook to drink,When, leaning o’er its crumbling brink,An ant fell in, and vainly tried,In this, to her, an ocean tide,To reach the land; whereat the dove,With every living thing in love,Was prompt a spire of grass to throw her,By which the ant regain’d the shore.A barefoot scamp, both mean and sly,Soon after chanced this dove to spy;And, being arm’d with bow and arrow,The hungry codger doubted notThe bird of Venus, in his pot,Would make a soup before the morrow.Just as his deadly bow he drew,Our ant just bit his heel.Roused by the villain’s squeal,The dove took timely hint, and flewFar from the rascal’s coop;—And with her flew his soup..
