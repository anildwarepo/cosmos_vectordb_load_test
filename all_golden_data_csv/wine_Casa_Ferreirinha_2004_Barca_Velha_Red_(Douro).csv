country: Portugal.
description: This is the latest release of Portugal's most iconic wine. It's made only in selected years (the last vintage was 2000) from Ferreira's Quinta da Leda in the Douro Superior. This new vintage is superb. It's a richly tarry wine laden with dark plum fruits and tannins that are just beginning to mature. It's a ripe and luscious, demanding attention, yet will still age for many years. Drink now, or hold until 2020..
