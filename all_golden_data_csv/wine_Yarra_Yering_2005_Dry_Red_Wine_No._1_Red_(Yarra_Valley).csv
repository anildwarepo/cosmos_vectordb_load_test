country: Australia.
description: This is a little slow out of the gate, starting off with some rather cabbage-like aromas. Over time, the odors evolve toward smoke and ash, and, finally, into a complex, cedary aroma. The flavors of this medium-bodied blend (80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Malbec, 8% Merlot, 2% Petit Verdot) feature blackberry and cassis, but also fold in hints of smoked meat and vanilla before finishing crisp and long. This really evolves and improves in the glass, suggesting 10-plus years of potential longevity..
