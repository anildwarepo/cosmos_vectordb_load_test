Description: From the Publisher: Western philosophy starts with Socrates and his student Plato. By way of the dialectic that evolved between master and student, Plato invented the philosophical method of inquiry and analysis, and became the first to use a logical framework to ask-and try to answer-the eternal questions about ethics, politics, art, and life that still haunt humanity. Along with such exemplars of Plato's thought as Symposium, Apology, and Phaedrus, this volume includes the first three books of Plato's Laws..
