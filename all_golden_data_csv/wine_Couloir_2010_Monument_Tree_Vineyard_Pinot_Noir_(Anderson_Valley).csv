country: US.
description: The vineyard has been source to Pinot Noirs from Copain and Drew, and this one, from Winemaker Jon Grant shows a somewhat Cabernet-esque interpretation. The wine is dark, tannic and medium-bodied, and quite extracted in the flashily ripe cherry and cola fruit that Monument Tree ripens so well in a cool, long hangtime year like 2010. Despite the richness, this is an elegant, ageworthy wine, whose low alcohol will delight many who critique California Pinot Noir for clumsiness. Give it at least six years in a good cellar..
