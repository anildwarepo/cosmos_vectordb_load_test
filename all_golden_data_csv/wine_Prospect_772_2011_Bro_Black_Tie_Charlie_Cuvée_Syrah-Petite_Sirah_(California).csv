country: US.
description: A perfect balance between Syrah and Petite Sirah from Calaveras County-based Prospect 772 this new offering hits it out of the park in terms of its dark, near-black color and subdued leather saddle and blueberry aromas. With rounded tannins, this is an intense wine with a distinct sense of personality, concentrated, savory, earthy and ready to age until 2019–2029 or decant awhile before settling into your glass..
