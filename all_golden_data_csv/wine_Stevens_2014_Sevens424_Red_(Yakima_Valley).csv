country: US.
description: This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (39%), Cabernet Franc (29%), Merlot (19%), Malbec (9%) and Petit Verdot. It explores the first two varieties's leafier sides, with aromas of garden herbs followed by graphite, orange peel and barrel spice. The palate is tart and fresh, full of cranberry flavors supported by lightly chewy tannins. It brings a pleasing sense of acidity that bodes well for its longevity..
