title: The Ass Dressed in Lion's Skin.
text: Clad in a lion’s shaggy hide,An ass spread terror far and wide,And, though himself a coward brute,Put all the world to scampering rout:But, by a piece of evil luck,A portion of an ear outstuck,Which soon reveal’d the errorOf all the panic terror.Old Martin did his office quick.Surprised were all who did not know the trick,To see that Martin, at his will,Was driving lions to the mill!In France, the men are not a fewOf whom this fable proves too true;Whose valour chiefly doth resideIn coat they wear and horse they ride..
