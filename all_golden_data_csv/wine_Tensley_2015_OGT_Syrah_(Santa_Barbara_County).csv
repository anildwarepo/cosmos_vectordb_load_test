wine_Tensley_2015_OGT_Syrah_(Santa_Barbara_County),"Unnamed: 0: 120102.
country: US.
description: This magnum-size wine, named after the Tensleys' son, Oliver Gunnar, is still very young, especially for the large size, but the aromas of purple flower, tar, salt, pepper and black plum are very promising. Zesty pepper and thyme show on the sip along with black-plum paste and savory hoisin touches, held together by a very grippy texture. This heavy-duty wine needs time to blossom. Drink 2019â€“2030..
