country: US.
description: The bright gold color and botrytis aromas tell you right off the bat that this is late-harvest juice. In the mouth, the extract and thickness are that of Vendanges Tardives Alsace whites, and flavor-wise, there's quince, peach and cinnamon, along with more botrytis and white raisins. Quite interesting for the region and a solid take on European-style late-harvest Gewurz. Possibly best with blue cheese or foie gras..
