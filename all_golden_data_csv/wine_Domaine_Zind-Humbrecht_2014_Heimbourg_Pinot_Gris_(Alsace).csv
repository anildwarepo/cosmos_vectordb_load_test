country: France.
description: The creamy, rich notes of freshly baked pear tart reach the senses first. Next the palate offers a soft, gentle and almost breezy freshness with citrus peel, floral overtones, creamy hints of shortbread and something primal like rock and stone. All of this is held together in a tableau of freshness, poise and elegance. The dry and lasting finish hints at riches to come, and this lovely wine will develop further. Drink now until 2030..
