country: US.
description: Winemaker Jim Law has fashioned a finessed Chardonnay that offers impressive purity and minerality, bearing Burgundian-like qualities. Notes of pear, green apple, kiwi and white currant are offset by a lemon-lime edge. It's all layered with streaks of blonde caramel and toasted hazelnut that add richness. The palate is clean, linear and vibrant, with a modicum of clove and a vein of liquid stone. The finish remains fresh and lifted..
