country: US.
description: So rich it tastes like chocolate, this ambitious and lavishly oak-influenced wine pulls out all the stops to achieve maximum flavor impact. It smells full of baking spices and savory herbs, tastes very ripe, concentrated and feels lush and creamy in texture. While full bodied, it has plenty of firm acidity and lots of fine tannins to stand up to all that flavor. It's ready to enjoy now through 2020..
