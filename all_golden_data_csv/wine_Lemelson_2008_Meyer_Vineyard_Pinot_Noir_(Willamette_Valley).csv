country: US.
description: Lemelson makes a consistent lineup of single vineyard Pinots, and with a track record extending back a decade or more, the results are predictably satisfying. The Meyer has a solid core of blackberry and black cherry, highlighted with a lining of licorice, scents of dried herb and citrusy acids. Beautifully styled and riding on perfectly ripened fruit, it will be hard to keep your hands off it, but it can cellar for 5–6 more years..
