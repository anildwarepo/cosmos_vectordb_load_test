wine_Domaine_Ostertag_2015_Clos_Mathis_Riesling_(Alsace),"Unnamed: 0: 32255.
country: France.
description: Lovely freshness rises: pear peel and citrus leaf, grapefruit zest and ripe mirabelle plum. The palate holds the same lusciously ripe notions still in a very tight embrace, bound with the freshest zestiest lemon. Those opposing poles of luscious ripeness and boundless freshness on a dry palate create drama, tension and moreishness. This is clean and invigorating and will gain over the years. Drink now through 2030..
