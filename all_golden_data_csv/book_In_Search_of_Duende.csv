Description: Federico Garcia Lorca was born in Spain in 1898 and executed in 1936, during the Spanish Civil War. The notion of ""duende""--a demonic earth spirit--became a fixation of Lorca's poetics over the course of his career. This book gathers Lorca's writings about the duende, and a full bilingual sampling of his poetry also is included, with special attention to poems arising from traditional Spanish verse forms..
