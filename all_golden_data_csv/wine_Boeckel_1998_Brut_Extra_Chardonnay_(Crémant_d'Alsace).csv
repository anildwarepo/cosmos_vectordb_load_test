country: France.
description: Initially restrained, the nose unfolds slowly in shades of ripe apple, dried apricot and honey. The honeyed notes become more effusive with air, edging towards honeycomb and butter shortbread. Despite this richness which also illuminates the palate, the body of this vintage crémant—which was on its lees in magnum for more than a decade—remains slender, chalky and totally pure. This 100% varietal wine is made from the oldest Chardonnay vines in Alsace, planted in 1968. Purity of fruit speaks as much as soil and place—united by the long flavor fusion and development of lees ageing..
