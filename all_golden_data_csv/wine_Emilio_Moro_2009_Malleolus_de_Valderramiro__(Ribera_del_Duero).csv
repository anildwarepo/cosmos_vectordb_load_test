description: After two marginal vintages (2007–08), this is Emilio Moro and Ribera del Duero at their finest. This Tinto Fino delivers a huge wave of mocha, blackberry, tobacco and coffee aromas in front of a dense and layered palate that's packed with prune, chocolate, cassis and blackberry flavors. A savory, richly textured finish overflowing with coffee, chocolate and smoky flavors seals the deal. Drink from 2015–2022..
