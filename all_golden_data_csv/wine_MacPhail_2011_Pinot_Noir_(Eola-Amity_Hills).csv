country: US.
description: A highly-regarded California producer of Pinot Noir dips its toe into the Oregon waters with this inaugural vintage from the Roserock Vineyard in the Eola-Amity Hills AVA. It's impressive, elegant and sensual, with the subtle complexity for which the grape is famous. Rose petals, red fruits, light spices, a compelling texture and mouthfeel, and overall elegance all point to a wine with a decade or more of life ahead..
