country: France.
description: Chamomile and ripe, red-apple notes make for an appetizing nose. The palate adds lovely vivid notes of zesty tangerine to this. Aromas of hay flowers also appear on this shimmering, aromatic, tight, taut and linear Riesling. Concentration fills the mouth with wonderfully light but sure-footed brightness and flavor. The dry long finish has a grounding earthy touch. Simply wonderful. Drink 2017–2035..
