country: US.
description: True to the Clos du Val paradigm, this wine offers ripe California fruit rendered traditionally-in this case in a Burgundian manner. The fruit rides high on the bright acidity; full, meaty black cherry and earth aromas and flavors sport attractive licorice accents. Big on the palate but not heavy, the wine finishes dry with dark cherry and mineral notes, fairly full tannins. This very good California Pinot Noir should improve over the next two or three years. A fine candidate for the short to mid-term cellar..
