country: US.
description: This Super-Tuscan blend of Howell Mountain Sangiovese and Stag's Leap Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc is one dark wine. It smells big, too, like an egg cream, which New Yorkers will understand. This chocolatey wine has hints of malt, while the flavors are vast, suggesting ripe blackberries. It's a huge wine in extract and mouthfeel. This creates awkward food-pairing challenges. Barbecued ribs come to mind -- but at $45?.
