country: US.
description: You'll find the hard tannins associated with Diamond Creek's Cabs, as well as an iodine, metallic brittleness to this wine. The combination of the two makes this as tough as any young Napa Valley Cabernet could be. However, the core is potent, suggesting intensely concentrated black currants and blackberries, reduced to their elemental essence. Do not touch this wine before 2020, and it should still be going strong in 2030..
