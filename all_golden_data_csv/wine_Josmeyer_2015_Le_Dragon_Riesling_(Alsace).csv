wine_Josmeyer_2015_Le_Dragon_Riesling_(Alsace),"Unnamed: 0: 16172.
country: France.
description: A touch of flint flashes up briefly before fruity notes of ripe juicy apricot and peach take over. On the palate they are joined by a flash of lemon freshness that brightens and heightens the slender but concentrated palate. Lemon and peach, tangerine and mirabelle fill mouth and mind while the freshness blows away any sensory cobwebs. This is deeply satisfying, lovely now but sure to improve. Drink now through 2030..
