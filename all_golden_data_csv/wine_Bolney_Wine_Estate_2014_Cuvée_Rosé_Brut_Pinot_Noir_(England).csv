country: England.
description: A whiff of blossom clings to the appetizing hint of freshly cut red-apple peel on the nose of this very pale rosé. The palate adds richness and a touch of honey and chalk that provides a sonorous dimension, filling the mouth with the bounty of ripe, red apples. The mousse is creamy, underlining the ample structure that allows the ripe acidity to swirl alluringly across the palate. This brisk but generous sparkler would work on the table..
