country: South Africa.
description: This is a bold and powerful yet layered and nuanced wine, with hints of green peppercorn, tobacco leaf, cigar box and leather that add depth and interest to the cassis and brambly blackberry core. The gripping palate offers structured, mouthcoating tannins that are framed by ample acidity and ripe black berry tones. Notes of spicy black licorice and espresso unfold on the long finish. It's delicious now, but this will age beautifully through 2020..
