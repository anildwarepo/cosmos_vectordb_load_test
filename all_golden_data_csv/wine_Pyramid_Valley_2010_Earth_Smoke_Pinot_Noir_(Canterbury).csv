country: New Zealand.
description: Americans Claudia and Mike Weersing's estate vines are grown so close to the ground, they look almost like a bonsai vineyard. Made as naturally as possible, it's yielded a smoky, savory style of Pinot Noir that shows some dark plum and black olive fruit and a lingering, slightly chocolaty finish. The silky tannins suggest immediate drinkability, although its inherent balance and concentration suggest it'll make it to at least 2020..
