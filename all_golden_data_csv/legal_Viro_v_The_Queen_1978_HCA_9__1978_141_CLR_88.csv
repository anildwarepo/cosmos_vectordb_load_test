The respondent Commissioner lodge with the Court and with the taxpayer applicants draft declarations and/or orders giving effect to the reasons for judgment within fourteen days, including orders as to costs. 73 Be all that as it may, the taxpayer applicants submitted that the reasons for judgment of the Privy Council in Caffoor at 599-601, though not binding on the Federal Court, should be afforded ' the highest respect ' ( Viro v The Queen [1978] HCA 9 ; (1978) 141 CLR 88 at 135 per Mason J (as he then was)). I will later refer to Viro and other authority relating to Privy Council decisions. The taxpayer applicants submitted in any event that 'while Hoysted has not been specifically overruled by the High Court in relation to its application to tax matters, the High Court has referred with approval to the decision of the Privy Council in Caffoor , where the decision in Broken Hill was followed and Hoysted rejected', and I was referred again Chamberlain at 510, where the brief reference thereto was made by Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ and which I have earlier discussed as being at least arguably not sufficiently on point arising for present examination. The taxpayer applicants further submitted 'that whilst Hoysted remains good law in relation to the application of issue estoppel other than to tax cases, it is clear that the decision of the Privy Council in Broken Hill is to be preferred where the issue is the effect of a decision on one year of income on litigation over a different year'. In my opinion, so much is far from 'clear'. Indeed the framework of the taxpayer applicants' case was assembled by reference to authorities concerned not with particular situations involving the kind or scope of that the subject of the earlier concluded Spassked proceedings, which involved a factually comprehensive and complex enquiry as to the purpose and the objectives of application of the proceeds of borrowings in a substantial commercial context and moreover which also involved corporately related borrowers and corporately related lenders operating otherwise than at arms length, in order to determine the deductibility or otherwise for income tax purposes in relation to the years of income the subject of dispute which were immediately proximate to that year of income the subject of resolution by the earlier concluded Spassked proceedings. Of course, the purpose of application of the proceeds of borrowings by a taxpayer from a third party in one fiscal year for an income producing purpose may subsequently transpose to a non-income producing purpose to that of the proceeds of the original borrowing or of an ongoing borrowing, in either case from the same lender, whether in the course of the same or a subsequent fiscal year. 79 At this point of my review of submissions on authorities it is appropriate to address more closely the taxpayer applicants' contentions upon the theme generally as to the binding authoritative operation of decisions of the House of Lords and the Privy Council in Australia, irrespective of the Commissioner's contentions to the effect that the taxpayer applicants' reliance upon the leading English decisions of Broken Hill, Caffoor and Hope were in any event misplaced. Additionally however to what I have earlier cited in relation to Viro, my attention was drawn by the taxpayer applicants to the later decision of the High Court in Cook v Cook [1986] HCA 73 ; (1986) 162 CLR 376 at 390, where Mason, Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ jointly discussed the implications of the circumstance that the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was no longer the ultimate court of appeal or one of the ultimate courts of appeal in Australia, and said as follows: 'The history of this country and of the common law makes it inevitable and desirable that the courts of this country will continue to obtain assistance and guidance from the learning and reasoning of United Kingdom courts just as Australian courts will benefit from the learning and reasoning of other great common law courts. Subject, perhaps, to the special position of the House of Lords given in the period in which appeals lay from this country to the Privy Council, the precedents of other legal systems are not binding and are useful only to the degree of the persuasiveness of their reasoning.' The dicta would seem to have marginally modified the earlier authority of Skelton v Collins [1966] HCA 14 ; (1966) 115 CLR 94, where Kitto J said at 104 as follows: 'The position of this Court in relation to decisions of the House of Lords does not seem to me to need clarification. The Court is not, in a strict sense, bound by such decisions, but it has always recognized and must necessarily recognize their peculiarly high persuasive value'. The taxpayer applicants for their part also cited at 135 (per Mason J as he then was) and Hawkins v Clayton (1986) 5 NSWLR 109 at 136-137 (per McHugh JA as he then was). The taxpayer applicants asserted that the decision of the House of Lords in Hope was one of those cases referred to in Cook as being in a 'special position'. Whether in any event of course, the speeches in Hope provide the applicant taxpayers with the extent of assistance sought to be invoked is a further matter for their concern..
