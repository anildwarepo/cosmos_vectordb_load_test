country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Danie Steytler. This Cabernert Sauvignon-based wine, with 15% Cinsault, boasts a pretty, upfront floral character on the nose, expressed in waves of African violet and iris. It's supported by a core of ripe red-cherry and -berry fruit tones, and framed by medium tannins and moderate acidity that lends a crushed satin texture. Notes of incense, cocoa powder and sweet spice unfold on the satisfying finish. Drink nowâ€“2021..
