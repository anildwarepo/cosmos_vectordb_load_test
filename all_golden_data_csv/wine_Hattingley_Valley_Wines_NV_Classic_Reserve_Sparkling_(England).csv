country: England.
description: Smooth hints of apricot and vanilla immediately give the nose an impression of richness and generosity. The palate also has a creaminess and sonorous layers of gentle apple and stone fruit, mingling with notions of sponge cake. But this stays on the svelte side, brightened by a lightning flash of brisk crispness. It combines freshness and mellowness, showing what reserve wines can do to a delicious blend. The finish is dry, pure and delicious..
