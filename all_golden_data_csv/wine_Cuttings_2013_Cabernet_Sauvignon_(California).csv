wine_Cuttings_2013_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(California),"Unnamed: 0: 74058.
country: US.
description: A beautiful aroma like violets, cedar, light oak smoke and black cherry wafts from this deeply colored wine. It brings ripe fruit flavors and a hint of toasted oak to the palate, filling the mouth with juicy black cherry, cassis and blueberry. Touches of dark chocolate are bolstered by ample layers of fine-grained tannins. This is a full-bodied, lightly sweet and elegantly balanced wine to drink now through 2022..
