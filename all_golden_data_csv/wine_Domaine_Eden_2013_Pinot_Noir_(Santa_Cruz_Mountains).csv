country: US.
description: While this wine's Mount Eden sister bottling may better stand the test of time, the Domaine Eden is what most people will most like to drink right now, and it's cheaper too. Aromas of dried violets, uncrushed boysenberries and pencil lead make for an ethereal nose that seems to hold secrets one must uncover. Precise tannins on the palate offer floral yet savory flavors of black sesame, nori, violet and mulberry. It's mellow yet mysterious..
