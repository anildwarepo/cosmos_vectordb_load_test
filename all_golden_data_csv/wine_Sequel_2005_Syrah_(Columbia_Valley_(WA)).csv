country: US.
description: Australian winemaker John Duval is the winemaker for Long Shadows' signature Syrah. His experience shows in the Oz-like color (almost black), the spicy berry, plum, cherry and currant fruit, and the silky, polished tannins. Interestingly, Duval uses a splash of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend, rather than going with Viognier. The wine seems to be holding something back; it's definitely got some years ahead..
