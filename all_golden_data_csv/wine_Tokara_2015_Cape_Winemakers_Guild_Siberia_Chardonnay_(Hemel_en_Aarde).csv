country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Miles Mossop. There's beautiful concentration yet ample freshness to the ripe wood-grilled apple, pineapple, melon and lemon-curd aromas and flavors in this wine. A hint of toasted brioche adds depth, while accents of fresh herbs and pressed yellow flower add an earthy elegance. The palate is full and round, yet not overly so, with ample acidity to lift the mouthfeel while lingering flavors of apple pie and spiced orange dance seductively on the finish. Drink nowâ€“2022..
