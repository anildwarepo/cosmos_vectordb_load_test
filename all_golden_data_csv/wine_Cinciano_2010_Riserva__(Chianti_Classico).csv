wine_Cinciano_2010_Riserva__(Chianti_Classico),"Unnamed: 0: 23959.
country: Italy.
description: Made with 100% Sangiovese, this stunning but reserved wine opens with multifaceted aromas of underbrush, violet, black berries and just a whiff of leather. The delicious, structured palate delivers vibrant black cherry and ripe raspberry alongside notes of black pepper and grilled rosemary. It's impeccably balanced by fresh acidity and a tannic backbone. It's still young so give this time to fully develop. Drink 2016–2022..
