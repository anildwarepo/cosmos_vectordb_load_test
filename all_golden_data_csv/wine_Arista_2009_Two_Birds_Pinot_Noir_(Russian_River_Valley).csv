country: US.
description: All kinds of fantastic things swirl together in this complex, intricate Pinot Noir, but it's too young to touch for a while. The '09 vintage was a great one for Arista's Pinots, and this bottling is their best, a small-production blend of four vineyards. Purists will object that it's a little too forward in sweet fruit, but the raspberries and cherries have interesting cola and mushroom complexities that sing of the soil, while lots of new oak adds rich layers of toast. Beautiful, but needs 4â€“5 years to begin to come around..
