description: Fox Run's  Geology Series is a remarkable study of Finger Lakes terroir and winemaking, and the 11 Riesling is a particularly fantastic result. Inoculated using the pied de cuve method, this semisweet Riesling shows apple and floral notes. A lush, textured palate is brimming with apricot and peach flavors. It's a complex wine layered with minerality, fruit and floral tones, and has an exceptionally long finish..
