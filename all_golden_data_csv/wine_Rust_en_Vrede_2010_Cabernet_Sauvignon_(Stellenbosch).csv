country: South Africa.
description: Attractive fragrances of mulled berries, cassis and black cherry lead the fruity bouquet of this wine, with added interest from supporting notes of sweet smoke, pepper and licorice root. The mouthfeel is creamy and full, but with ample tannin and acidity to provide structure and lend a gripping texture. Ripe flavors of plum, fig, cassis, black tea and leather flood the palate and linger long on the finish. Drink nowâ€“2018..
