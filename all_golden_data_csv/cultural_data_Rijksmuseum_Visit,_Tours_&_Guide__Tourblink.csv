First Page Reviews: I love this app, it is nice to have explanations on the paintings at my fingertips. I wish it were more expansive, there were so many more treasures. what a disappoint, we planned on using this app after checking it out on my wife's iPhone 10, unfortunate I down load it on my Samsung s7 and it crashes every time. tried rebooting and reinstalling no just crashes. We don't know a ot of arts but with this app we enjoy the quick visit in the museum and we buy the ticket. 100% recommendable App tries to trick you into rating 5 stars on play store using cheap tricks.
