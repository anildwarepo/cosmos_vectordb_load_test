country: US.
description: Tamarack blends grapes from an astonishing number of sites scattered across the length and breadth of the Columbia Valley, and yet makes wines that are distinctive, polished, generous, and focused. The 2008 Merlot includes 5% each Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc. Its structure is firmly Cab-like, its fruit broadly displayed across the midpalate, a mix of ripe strawberries and cherries dusted with sweet baking spices and cocoa. It's a joyride from start to finish..
