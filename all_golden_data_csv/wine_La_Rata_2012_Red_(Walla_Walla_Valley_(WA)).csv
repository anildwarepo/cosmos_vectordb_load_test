country: US.
description: This is the inaugural release from Elizabeth Bourcier, assistant vigneronne at Cayuse Vineyards. A unique blend of Grenache (60%) and Cabernet Sauvignon, it clearly comes from The Rocks, with the aromas of black olive, peat, fire pit, raspberry and herbs popping. The smoked meat and savory flavors show elegance, depth, detail and restraint, with a finish that sails. It's a subtle, sublime wine that makes a statement..
