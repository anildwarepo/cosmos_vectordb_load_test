country: US.
description: Spice marks this dry, delicate offering, with notes of white pepper, cinnamon and nutmeg. But it's also richly fruity in wild cherries and raspberries. In recent years, Drew has been producing remarkably complex and ageworthy Pinots, and this lovely wine, which is not a single-vineyard bottling, shows the winery's continued mastery. It's a particular success given the enormous challenges of the 2010 vintage. Drink nowâ€“2018..
