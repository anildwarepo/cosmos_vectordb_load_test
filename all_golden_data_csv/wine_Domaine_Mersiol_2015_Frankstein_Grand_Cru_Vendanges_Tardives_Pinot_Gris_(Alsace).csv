country: France.
description: If the term “mellow” were to be made into a liquid this would be it. Both nose and palate have the sonorous gentle richness of very ripe pear, with the richness of some dried pear fruit, too. This late-harvest style has sweet richness but is also utterly balanced. There is enough freshness and structure to corral the fruit into something easy, gentle, generous and warming. This is so unobtrusive, so balanced that it might disappear very quickly..
