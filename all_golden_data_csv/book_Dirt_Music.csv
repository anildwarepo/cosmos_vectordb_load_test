Description: âe~Generous, earthy and raw . . . Mysteries donâe(tm)t come more heartfelt than thisâe(tm) Independent Georgie Jutland is a mess. At forty, with her career in ruins, she finds herself stranded with a fisherman she doesnâe(tm)t love and two kids whose dead mother she can never replace. Her days have fallen into domestic tedium and social isolation. Her nights are a blur of vodka and pointless loitering in cyberspace. One morning, in the boozy pre-dawn gloom, she looks up from the computer screen to see a shadow lurking on the beach below, and a dangerous new element enters her life. Luther Fox, the local poacher. Jinx. Outcast. So begins an unlikely alliance. Set in the wild landscape of Western Australia, this is a novel about the odds of breaking with the past, a love story about people stifled by grief or regret, whose dreams are lost, whose hopes have dried up. Itâe(tm)s a journey across landscapes within and without, about the music that sometimes arises from the dust. âe~Winton keeps writing fiction that makes the novel feel alive to a continent of possibilitiesâe(tm) Evening Standard âe~Winton is not a great Australian novelist; he is a great novelist, full stopâe(tm) The Times.
