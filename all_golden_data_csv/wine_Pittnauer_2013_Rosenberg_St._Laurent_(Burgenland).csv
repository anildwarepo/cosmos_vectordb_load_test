country: Austria.
description: The purest scent of fresh, ripe red cherries is the first pleasure to be encountered on this elegant wine. On the slender palate this lovely fruit expression is joined by earthier tones of undergrowth and peat. There is a central seam of freshness that pulls fruit, silky tannin and soft texture together. If there was just one attribute I could name it would be elegance. Lovely and fresh now but Rosenberg ages most gracefully. Drink 2016–2024..
