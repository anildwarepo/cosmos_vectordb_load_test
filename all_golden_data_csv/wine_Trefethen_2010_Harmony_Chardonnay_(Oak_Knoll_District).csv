country: US.
description: This ambitious effort from Trefethen was grown in a block of the estate vineyard. No effort was spared, with careful clonal selection, tasteful oak application and all the bells and whistles of Burgundian technique. The result, however, leaves something to be desired. There's a taste of green pea lurking in the background behind the tropical fruit, green apple and peach flavors that must be due to the unusually chilly vintage..
