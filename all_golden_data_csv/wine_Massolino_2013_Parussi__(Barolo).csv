wine_Massolino_2013_Parussi__(Barolo),"Unnamed: 0: 119653.
country: Italy.
description: Firmly structured and loaded with energy, this intense red opens with aromas of new leather, pipe tobacco, eucalyptus and a whiff of cake spice. The aromas carry over to the vibrant palate along with raspberry and cherry set against a firm backbone of assertive but refined tannins. Tightly wound and youthfully austere, it still needs time but seems destined to blossom into a beauty. Drink 2025–2043..
