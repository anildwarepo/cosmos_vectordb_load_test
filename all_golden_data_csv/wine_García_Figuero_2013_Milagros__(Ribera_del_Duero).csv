wine_García_Figuero_2013_Milagros__(Ribera_del_Duero),"Unnamed: 0: 105163.
country: Spain.
description: Milagros means “miracles,” and the marvel is how good this wine is considering how rough in general 2013 was in the Ribera del Duero region. Oaky aromas of root beer and blackberry are smooth and heady. This wine is intense, with big tannins and firm acidity. Faith will be rewarded down the line with potent berry and chocolaty oak flavors. Bottle age should help this soften up; drink from 2020–2030..
