Description: Computer whiz Ashley Patterson is convinced she is being stalked. Coworker Toni Prescott has a penchant for Internet dating and little time for anyone else.

They know virtually nothing about each other--until the three women are linked by a murder investigation that will lead to one of the most bizarre trials of the century..
