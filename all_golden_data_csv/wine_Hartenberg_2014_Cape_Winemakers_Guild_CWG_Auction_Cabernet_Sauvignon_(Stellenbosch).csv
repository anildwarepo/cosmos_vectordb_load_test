country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Carl Schultz. Initial scents of burnt popcorn and charred oak give way to seductive notes of black forest cake, raspberry and boysenberry that take center stage on the plush palate. Firm yet dusty tannins lend a solid structure through the close, which offers additional, lingering flavors of toasted spice, vanilla bean and campfire. The depth of fruit, solid structure and harmonious overall balance suggest this will mature well through 2024..
