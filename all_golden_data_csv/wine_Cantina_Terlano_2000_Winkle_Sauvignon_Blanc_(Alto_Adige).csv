country: Italy.
description: In northeast Italy (in this case Alto Adige) they don't use the “Blanc” qualifier, but this is definitely SB. Lemon and mineral qualities are strong on the nose and in the mouth, while driving acids create a mouth-watering feel. While citrus rind and a touch of toast offer nice secondary qualities, the main flavors are apple and something akin to tangerine. A distant almond marzipan note comes on as a lasting final impression..
