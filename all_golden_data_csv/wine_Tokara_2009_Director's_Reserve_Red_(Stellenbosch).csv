country: South Africa.
description: A blend of 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Petit Verdot, 5% Merlot and 5% Malbec, this is a tight, focused selection, with excellent precision to the black plum, blackberry, dried raspberry and cassis fruit core. Well-integrated accents of leather, cigar box and pine resin add depth and complexity. The medium-weight palate is structured yet elegant, with fine-grain, lingering tannins. Drink now through 2020..
