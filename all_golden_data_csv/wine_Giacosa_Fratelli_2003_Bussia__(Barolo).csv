country: Italy.
description: Giacosa Fratelli (to be distinguished from the venerable house of Bruno Giacosa) tends to make good, solid wines but never anything really earth shattering. This proved to be one of his best, a lovely nose of dark fruit, chocolate, soy and smoked meat. Quite soft on the palate, but rich and layered,and although it showed a touch of mid palate hollowness, the finish was good if somewhat chunky. Needs 3-5 years to really come round..
