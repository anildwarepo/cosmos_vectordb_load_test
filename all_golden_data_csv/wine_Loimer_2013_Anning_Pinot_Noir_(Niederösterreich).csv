country: Austria.
description: Flinty notions of (good) reduction still grace the closed nose and bring memories of Burgundian cellars. The palate has a masterfully light touch. The fruit is tart and red, hinting at red currant and crushed cranberries with a pleasant, inviting tartness that exudes aroma and focuses the palate with its preserving freshness. Yet there are notions of fragrant and ripe raspberries. This is a silky babe in arms, so wait for the wine to unfold fully from 2017 to 2020..
