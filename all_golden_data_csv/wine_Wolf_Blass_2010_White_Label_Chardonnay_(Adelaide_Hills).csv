country: Australia.
description: When a producer renowned for its red wines can turn out an elegant, understated white of this quality, you know Australian Chardonnay has firmly arrived. Subtle accents of toasted nuts frame citrusy fruit, and while the wine is full-bodied and round in the mouth, it remains focused and long and on the finish. If you're fortunate enough to get some of the 600 bottles imported, drink the wine over the next couple of years..
