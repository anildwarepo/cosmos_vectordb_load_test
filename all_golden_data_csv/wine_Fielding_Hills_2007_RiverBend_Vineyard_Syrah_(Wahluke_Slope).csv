country: US.
description: The Fielding Hills Syrah remains one of my favorites in a state loaded with great Syrahs, fruit-powered with spicy purple fruits, annotated with scents of game, anise, smoke and moist earth. The black and purple fruits dominate, as expressive and ripe as any Syrah in the state. It's still young, a bit oaky, and relatively high in alcohol. Give it some bottle age and all the complexity will come into focus..
