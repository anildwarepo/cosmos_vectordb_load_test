country: US.
description: Vintage Selection has long been the winery's age-worthy 100% Cabernet. Although this has an alcohol content that's higher than in the past, it should still reward cellaring. The wine is rich with a sweet blackberry flavor, with lots of new French oak. The tannins are hard, reminiscent of an older era of Napa Cabernet. Give it 5â€“6 years, but anything longer than that and the fruit may be threatened..
