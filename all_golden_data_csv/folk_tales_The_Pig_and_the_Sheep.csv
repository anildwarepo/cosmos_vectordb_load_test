title: The Pig and the Sheep.
text: A Pig found his way into a meadow where a flock of Sheep were grazing. The shepherd caught him, and was proceeding to carry him off to the butcher’s when he set up a loud squealing and struggled to get free. The Sheep rebuked him for making such a to-do, and said to him, “The shepherd catches us regularly and drags us off just like that, and we don’t make any fuss.” “No, I dare say not,” replied the Pig, “but my case and yours are altogether different: he only wants you for wool, but he wants me for bacon.”.
