wine_Chateau_Rollat_2006_Rollat_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Walla_Walla_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 44145.
country: US.
description: Less immediately accessible than the 2005, the 2006 is tight and tart and almost seems encased in some sort of a shell. The fruit is concentrated raspberry and plum, and the acids taste natural while the tannins are polished and proportionate. The wine stays focused and strong through a very long finish that dapples in toasted coconut and chocolate malt. If you are a Rollat collector (and you should be) this would be the wine to cellar for five or six years, waiting for the Edouard to come into full flower..
