wine_Quinta_Vale_Dona_Maria_2013_Vinha_do_Rio_Red_(Douro),"Unnamed: 0: 82824.
country: Portugal.
description: As its name suggests this wine comes from vines planted close to the Torto River that runs through the quinta. The extra warmth from the river produces extra-ripe grapes that go into this powerful, although impressively restrained wine. Foot trodden in traditional stone fermenters, the wine is rich with the same opulent texture as a vintage Port (although of course dry). Dark and for the long haul the wine should not be consumed before 2020..
