description: From the color— unusually dark for Pinot Noir—to the deeply fruity, earthy aromas, you expect something big, massive and ageworthy, and the first sip confirms this impression. This is serious Pinot. It comes across deep and powerful in the mouth, suggesting plums, sweet blackberries and a hint of sun-warmed tomato, and finishes with a blast of complex oak and spice. Complex now, it calls for complex dishes—the best game birds you can find—and will probably be even better with some time in the cellar..
