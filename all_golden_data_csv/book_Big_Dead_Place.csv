Description: In the desolate continent of Antarctica, the United States Government has set up three bases operated by the Raytheon corporation. These alleged ports of high science have seen little if any technical endeavours this century; nevertheless, the charade continues and many dozens of workers are cooped up together in high-tech communes. Harassed by a tic-tac bureaucracy that makes the Soviet Union look free and easy, these bases are filled with highly neurotic individuals who use their free time playing mind games with one another..
