country: US.
description: With a translucent ruby color and silky texture, this could be a Pinot Noir. But it's a blend of Sangiovese, Voignier, Mourv√®dre and several other varieties, and shows its own unique profile. Dry and crisp, the flavors are fruity, floral, herbal and spicy. Raspberries, cherries, thyme, white pepper, bacon, oregano and smoky sandalwood only begin to describe the complexities. They change by the second in the glass, but always finish dry..
