country: US.
description: This hits the jackpot. You taste it and are struck by its incredible richness, but then the balance kicks in, making it all the more impressive. It shows intense mountain flavors of blackberry, currant and dark chocolate, which are set into firm tannins. New oak brings delicious layers of vanilla and buttered toast. So good now, you can hardly keep your hands off the cork, but it should develop for many years..
