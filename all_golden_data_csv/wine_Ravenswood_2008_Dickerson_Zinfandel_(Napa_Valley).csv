country: US.
description: An interesting wine that grows more complex as it sits and warms in the glass. The vineyard long has been source to one of Ravenswood's best Zinfandels, and the 2007 was really great. This '08 is a tad less complex, but shows classic Zinfandel character, with wild berry, tobacco and pepper spice notes, as well as a rocky minerality. It should age for a very long time, although the point score is unlikely to change..
