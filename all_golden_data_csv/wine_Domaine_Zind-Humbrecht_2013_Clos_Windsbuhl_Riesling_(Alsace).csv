country: France.
description: Tender notes of citrus appear at first through a veil of yeast. Their zestiness then fills out with subtle, earthy spice. On the light, dry palate, the true subtlety hits: wafts of lemon, aromatic wild thyme, Seville orange zest, fresh apple peel and wet stone. The delicacy of the concentrated body is astonishing, with a central vein of lemony freshness that provides a focal point. So subtle, so layered and alive: with every new sip new nuances occur..
