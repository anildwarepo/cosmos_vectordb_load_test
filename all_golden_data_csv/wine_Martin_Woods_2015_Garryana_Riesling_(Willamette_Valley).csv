country: US.
description: Garryana is the winery's previous moniker; once this vintage sells through all wines will be labeled Martin Woods. This bottling mixes green, gold and botrytized fruit from a single vineyard, all picked on the same day. The result is intriguing, though a bit disjointed. Bright gold, pungent and waxy in the mouth, it mixes accents of honeycomb with green-apple fruit that almost tastes like straight cider. The finish is quite dry..
