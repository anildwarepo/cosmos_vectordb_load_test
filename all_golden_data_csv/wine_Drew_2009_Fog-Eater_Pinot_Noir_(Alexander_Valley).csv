country: US.
description: Drew used to release this bottling some 16 or 17 months after the vintage. This wine has been rushed to market at barely more than a year of age. As a result, this young wine shows the ripe flavors and structural integrity of earlier vintages, such as the wonderful 2007, but it's rude in jam and acids. If you buy it, do what the winery should have: store it for at least an additional year, and better yet, three..
