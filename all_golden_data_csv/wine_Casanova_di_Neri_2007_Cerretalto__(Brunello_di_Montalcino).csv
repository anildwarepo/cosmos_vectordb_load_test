country: Italy.
description: It takes only a few moments before you appreciate the enormity, intensity and overall beauty of this landmark wine. Cerretalto is always a high scoring expression of Brunello, but the ideal conditions of the 2007 vintage elevate it to earthly perfection. Dark and fleshy, the wine delivers ever-evolving aromas of dark fruit, chocolate, spice and tobacco. The acidity is carefully balanced against the wine's thickness and rich texture. The finish is long, luscious and elegant. Keep this bottle in your cellar 10 years or more..
