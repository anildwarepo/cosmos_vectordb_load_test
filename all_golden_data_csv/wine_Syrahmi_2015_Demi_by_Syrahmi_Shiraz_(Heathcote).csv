country: Australia.
description: This is a simultaneously fruity and savory wine of complexity and power from one of Victoria's underrated regions, Heathcote. From a mix of granite and the region's famed Cambrian red soils, this wine offers ripe blue and red fruit, florals and a peppery, olivey punch. The juicy fruit continues on the palate but here the savory elements play more of a starring role: Dried herbs and graphite are woven into fine-grained tannins and a long, almost tangy finish. Drink nowâ€“2027..
