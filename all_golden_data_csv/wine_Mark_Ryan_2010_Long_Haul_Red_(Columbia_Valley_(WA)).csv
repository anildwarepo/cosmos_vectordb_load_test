country: US.
description: The production of Long Haul has doubled in 2010, and vineyard sources have changed, though most remain on Red Mountain despite the Columbia Valley appellation. The Bordeaux-style blend is 61% Merlot, 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Cabernet Franc, 9% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot. It has drying tannins that somewhat mask the tart berry fruit. There's more stem and earth apparent in the palate, perhaps due to the addition of Cabernet Sauvignon. It's quite Bordeaux-like, in style and finish..
