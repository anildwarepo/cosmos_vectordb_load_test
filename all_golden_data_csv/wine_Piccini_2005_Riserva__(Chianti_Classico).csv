country: Italy.
description: This Riserva is measured in terms of its aromatic intensity and although it does deliver cherry, spice and warm notes of leather and almond, it does so in a very understated manner. The more you get to know it in the glass, the more you can identify delicate floral and ethereal aromas that point to a traditional Chianti Classico style. Sharp acidity and bright fruit flavors tell the same story in the mouth..
