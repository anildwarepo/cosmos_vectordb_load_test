country: US.
description: The fruit comes from the Seven Hills vineyard, on the Oregon side of the Walla Walla AVA. The fruit flavors are an intriguing mix of black cherry, plum and bourbon-soaked fig; there's nothing shy here. What is especially noteworthy is that winemaker Ken Wright has crafted a Syrah that is distinctively different from others that are using this fruit; it's more stylized, the fruit more precise, the barrel flavors more advanced..
