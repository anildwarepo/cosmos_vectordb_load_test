country: US.
description: Don't confuse this with the winery's regular Riesling, which is off-dry. This is their dry bottling, and it's a superior wine. Shows vital, crisp acidity that makes the mouth water, then follows up with rich citrus, green apple, Asian pear and peppery spice flavors that are tantalizing and complex. One of the more compelling dry Rieslings out there, but the 100-case production will make it hard to find..
