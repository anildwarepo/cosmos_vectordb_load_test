country: US.
description: There's a very fine wine lurking inside this bottle, but right now, everything's disjointed. There are big tannins over here, oak over there, and sandwiched in between are huge, intense flavors of blackberry, blueberry and cassis liqueur. It's nowhere near ready, but there's no reason why this dramatic young wine shouldn't come together and improve over the years. Cellar it until 2017 and check up on it; this could be really something in 2025..
