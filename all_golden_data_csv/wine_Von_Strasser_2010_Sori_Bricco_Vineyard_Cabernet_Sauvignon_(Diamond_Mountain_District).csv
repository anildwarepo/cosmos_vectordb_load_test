country: US.
description: This is an enormous Cabernet, as packed with intensity and power as anything in Napa Valley. The vineyard is Von Strasser's highest on the mountain, which maximally exposes it to the sun, and you can taste the solar ripeness in the intense essence of black currants and dark chocolate. The tannins exhibit classic Diamond Mountain potency. This is a dense Cabernet that needs serious time in the cellar. Hold until 2019, and it will continue to develop for many years afterward..
