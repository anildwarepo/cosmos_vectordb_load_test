country: US.
description: Tribute is 41% Syrah, 30% Merlot and 27% Cabernet Sauvignon, all estate-grown. The bouquet opens immediately into a fascinating complexity. What wafts up from the glass is a heady mix of incense, smoke, jam, toast, iron and herb—you can spend a pleasant 10 or 15 minutes just counting all the threads. Spicy, loaded with raspberry and strawberry fruit, gentle acids and silky tannins, this glides comfortably into a tangy finish..
