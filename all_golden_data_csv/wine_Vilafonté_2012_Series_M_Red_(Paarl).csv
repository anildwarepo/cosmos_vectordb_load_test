wine_Vilafonté_2012_Series_M_Red_(Paarl),"Unnamed: 0: 127280.
country: South Africa.
description: This blend of 48% Merlot, 35% Malbec and 17% Cabernet Sauvignon is plush and accessible, with attractively ripe notes of brambly blackberry, raspberry and cherry on the nose and palate. Soft, spicy tannins lend the wine a crushed-velvet texture, while hints of licorice, vanilla bean, fruitcake spice and black tea add depth to the medium-weight mouthfeel and linger long through the finish. Drinkable now, but should hold well through 2020..
