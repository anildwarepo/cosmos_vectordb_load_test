country: Italy.
description: Moccagatta's expression from the Basarin cru will blow you away. This thickly extracted Barbaresco opens with a rich, dark appearance and opulent aromas of sweet spice, leather, toasted almond, vanilla and ripe cherry fruit. This is a big, masculine wine that would pair with pork medallions and caramelized onions. The finish is soft and slightly sweet. Keep it in your cellar 10 years or more. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers..
