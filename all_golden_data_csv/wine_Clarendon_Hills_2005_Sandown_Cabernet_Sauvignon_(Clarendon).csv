country: Australia.
description: In some ways this is the most classically built 2005 Clarendon Hills Cabernet. There's a hint of greeness to the aromas and flavors that are not found in the other offerings, which may make it more or less appealing, depending on your tastes. Mint, cassis and vanilla mingle easily on the palate, which is lush and creamy but shows hints of Cabernet austerity at the same time. Drink nowâ€“2020. Imported by Wine Brokers Unlimited..
