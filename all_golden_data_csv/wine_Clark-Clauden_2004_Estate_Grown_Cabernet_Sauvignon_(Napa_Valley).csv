country: US.
description: This is a gorgeous Cabernet, but it's pretty young, and while it's delicious now due to the ripe fruit, it really needs time. Wrapped in fresh, tight tannins, it displays powerful red and black currant, blackberry, cherry, chocolate and vanilla oak flavors, and shows the elegant, important mouthfeel of a top Napa Cab. Give it until after 2008, if you can keep your hands off, and will come into its own after 2010..
