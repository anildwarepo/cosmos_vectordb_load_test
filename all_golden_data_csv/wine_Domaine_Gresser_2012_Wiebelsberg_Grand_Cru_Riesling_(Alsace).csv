country: France.
description: This wine carries aromas of white blossom in the dusk and freshly ripened stone fruit. The palate continues on this dreamy note, enveloping the tart-ripe freshness of red apples and a touch of citrus. The fruit is remarkably ripe and fresh for a wine from the 2012 vintage. The just off-dry palate hides nothing and just charms and entices. Lovely, dreamy, pure flavors from start to long, long finish. Drink 2017–2030..
