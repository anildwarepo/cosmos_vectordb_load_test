wine_Pamplin_2011_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 103611.
country: US.
description: Almost entirely varietal (3% Petit Verdot) with the fruit mostly split between Elephant Mountain and Alder Ridge vineyards, this wine is a bit aromatically locked up at present with notes of cherry, green herbs and blue fruit. It's medium bodied in feel, with the oak dialed back (33% new French), tart acids and a gentle squeeze of tannins with bitters on the finish. It should only improve with additional time in the bottle and has a lot life ahead of it..
