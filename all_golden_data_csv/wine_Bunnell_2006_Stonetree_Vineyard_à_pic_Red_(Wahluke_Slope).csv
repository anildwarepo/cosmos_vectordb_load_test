country: US.
description: The concept here is a southern Rhône blend—47% Syrah, 17% Grenache, 19% Cinsault and 17% Mourvèdre. With the extra dollop of Syrah, it's got more substance than the usual Châteauneuf wannabes. Spicy and sharp, this benefits from the fact that the grapes all came in at once and were co-fermented, so the blend married early and well. Despite its youth, this is seamless and focused; a complete and very successful wine with berry, cherry and sweet plum fruit flavors annotated with spice and bits of chocolate. Elegant, feminine and supple, this is a lovely bottle..
