country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Marc Kent. The bouquet of this attractive Syrah offers a pleasant interplay between floral tones of crushed violet and iris and fruity notes of ripe blackberry and blueberry. The medium-weight palate is plush and seductive, with a texture like crushed velvet and brambly, spice-accented flavors of black cherry and forest berry. Hints of bittersweet chocolate shavings and subtle char grace the elegant finish. Cellaring will encourage additional depth and complexity; drink 2020â€“2025..
