country: US.
description: Sangiovese has been a major disappointment in Napa Valley, but guess what? This 97% Sangiovese, with 3% Cabernet Sauvignon, is an impressive wine, and the best of Gargiulo's current releases. It's enormously forward in cherry pastry filling flavors, while plenty of new oak adds smoky, cinnamon spicy, vanilla brul√©e complexities, but it's the quality of the tannins that marks the wine. For all its flamboyance, it doesn't seem like an ager. Best now through 2011..
