country: US.
description: The Del Rio vineyard, in southern Oregon's Rogue Valley AVA, has pioneered the cultivation of Syrah in that part of the Northwest. As the vines acquire some age, they are coming into focus, and the rough tannins seem to be more in balance with the fruit. These wines are somewhat similar in style to the Syrahs from the Okanagan valley of Canada, and they offer an earthy mix of flavor that puts the fruit under earth, soy, coffee and smoke. Tannins in this Tyrus Evan are beautifully managed, with the edges sanded down, and the wine has a lovely, lingering presence on the palate..
