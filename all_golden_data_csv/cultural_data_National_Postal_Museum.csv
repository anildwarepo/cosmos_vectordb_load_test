First Page Reviews: I would have liked to use this app, but I only got as far as a message that there was no network connection. None of the other apps I use has this complaint. Not sure what's wrong, and I'm not going to waste time figuring it out. Looking Good! I hope to see more about other exibits and special collections, the videos added a nice touch. Thank you..
