country: US.
description: Following in the footsteps of the Evolution White, this nonvintage blend is labeled by edition, as the mix of grapes does change from release to release. Here the base wine is Syrah, amended with a paintbox of both red and white grapes. It's aromatic and unique, silky smooth and loaded with pretty plum and cherry fruit. The mouthfeel is luscious, the flavors beautifully blended, and the overall quality superb..
