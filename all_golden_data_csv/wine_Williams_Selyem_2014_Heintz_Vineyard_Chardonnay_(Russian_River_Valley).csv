country: US.
description: The Heintz Vineyard is on the outskirts of the AVA, really pushing toward the coast, with the expected cool-climate characteristics of fresh acidity and complex, savory tones. This wine wows in every way, from its notes of exotic coconut meat and apple pie to its tang of Meyer lemon, all accented by bergamot and anise. The spice rides a wave of body and length toward the finish, alongside an unmistakable streak of minerality. Hold through 2024..
