description: From the Happy Canyon-based team behind the ultra luxury Crown Point project comes this bottling, offering a taste of the high life for a slightly more affordable price. Pressed blueberry, black cherry and sour plum aromas mesh with dried oregano, bay leaf, black pepper and pencil shavings on the nose. There's lots of depth to the palate, with dark olallieberry, eucalyptus oil and pine needle flavors leading into a hazelnut, caramel, coffee and vanilla finish..
