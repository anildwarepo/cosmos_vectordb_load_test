country: US.
description: Hall, which has gotten huge scores over the years, now has this Mount Veeder bottling, but the warning is that they're playing with fire. It's so massive in fruit, it risks being ridiculed as a bombastic pop wine. There's no denying the power of the blackberries, currants, chocolate and oak, but there's a case to be made for elegance and restraint. Easily earns its high score, but the hope is that the winemaker will be mindful with future releases..
