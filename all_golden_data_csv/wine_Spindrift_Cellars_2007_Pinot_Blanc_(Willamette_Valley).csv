country: US.
description: Spindrift is the little winery that could, and makes excellent wines at consumer-friendly prices, from a variety of grapes that showcase all the strengths of Oregon. This lovely bottle is spicy and tart, yet full-flavored with a mix of lime, lemon, pineapple, pear and rind that gracefully runs into a midpalate that is full and spicy. The sharp acids keep it lively and refreshing, and the finish is nothing short of remarkable in a wine at this price..
