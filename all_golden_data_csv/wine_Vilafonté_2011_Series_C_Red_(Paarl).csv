wine_Vilafonté_2011_Series_C_Red_(Paarl),"Unnamed: 0: 115591.
country: South Africa.
description: A blend of 51% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% Merlot, 14% Malbec and 9% Cabernet Franc, this opens with rich, decadent scents of brandied cherries, blackberries, plum and crème de cassis, all married to assertive notes of black pepper, licorice and tree bark. Structured yet fine-grain tannins result in an approachable palate and a texture like crushed satin, while the finish offers accents of cigar box and roasted cocoa nib. Drinkable now, but will hold well through 2020..
