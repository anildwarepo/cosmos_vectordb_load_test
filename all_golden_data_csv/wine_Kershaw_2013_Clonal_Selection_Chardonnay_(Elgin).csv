country: South Africa.
description: This Chardonnay hits all the right marks, as toasty oak influence is coupled seamlessly with ripe fruit tones and balancing acidity. Gorgeous scents of yellow apple, melon and honeysuckle transition through to the medium-weight palate, where they are met by attractive oak spice tones, a subtle tannic texture and refreshing acidic lift. The finish is long and evolving, and this should drink well through 2020..
