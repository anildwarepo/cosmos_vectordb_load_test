First Page Reviews: I enjoy the artwork, but the Playlists won't load. Why have a playlist, and an app for an immersive experience, and then not actually play the music? Bizarre app Nothing loads up hoping it's a glitch you can sort out soon. Click on an exhibition and all I get are blank squares. The app does not work.Stops all the time..
