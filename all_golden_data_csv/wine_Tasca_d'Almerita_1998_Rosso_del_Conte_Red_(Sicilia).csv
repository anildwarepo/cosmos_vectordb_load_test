country: Italy.
description: A proprietary blend inspired by Chateauneuf-du-Pape, the Count's Red is more closed than the other offerings from Tasca, showing little on the nose beyond chocolate. In the mouth, raspberry fruit begins to emerge; the wine is obviously a big, full-bodied and tannic. It's meant to age, and we think it will do so just fine. Try in 2008, or pair it with hearty meat dishes if you can't hold out that long..
