country: US.
description: This winery has had a reputation for making Cabs in a leaner, more ageworthy style, but that is no longer true, to judge by this '05. It's as ripe and fruity as anything out there, and immediately drinkable for its beautiful blackberry, black currant, chocolate and cedar flavors. Still, the tannins are considerable, and the wine should easily negotiate the years. Best now and through 2013, at the least..
