country: US.
description: A testament to the power of Paso Robles' wines, this blend of 37% Grenache, 34% Mourvèdre and 29% Syrah is dense, dark and viscous, showing candied blackberry, crème de cassis and pressed violet aromas, accented with cola and mocha notes. Soft, lush tannins massage the palate, growing grippier with time, while boisterous acidity releases blackberry, espresso and crushed slate flavors. Immensely likable now, it will also last for years..
