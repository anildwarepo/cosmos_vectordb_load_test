country: Italy.
description: Here's a delightfully voluptuous and chewy Sangiovese from Montalcino in southern Tuscany that offers lavish layers of succulent cherry, plum, spice and natural rubber. Thick, ripe fruit aromas are elaborated by 15 months of oak aging that adds background dimension and renderings of vanilla, cinnamon and toasted almond. It's a soft, velvety wine with plush consistency and drying tannins that would pair beautifully with tender venison medallions, wild mushroom risotto or meat ragout..
