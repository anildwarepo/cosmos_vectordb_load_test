country: South Africa.
description: The label reads “The Original coffee/chocolate Pinotage” and boy are they right! This is pure decadent bliss with intense aromas of crème de cacao, raspberry chocolate sauce and coffee granules along with hints of hickory bacon and tobacco. The mouth is huge, ripe and full, with a balanced structure and gorgeous flavors of juicy mashed black raspberries, plum flesh, sweet smoked meat and mocha that leads strongly throughout the lengthy finish. With 500 cases imported, this is a Pinotage worth searching out and trying..
