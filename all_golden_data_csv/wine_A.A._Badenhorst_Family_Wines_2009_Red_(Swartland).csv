country: South Africa.
description: This blend of 66% Shiraz, 16% Mourvèdre, 14% Grenache and 4% Cinsault is pure and balanced, with an immediately perceptable core of brambly berry that's accented by notes of white pepper, charred cedar, forest floor and cocoa nib. The medium-weight palate is fleshy yet firm, with spiced-fruit flavors and structured tannins. It's certainly drinkable now, but this will continue to mature and evolve nicely through 2018..
