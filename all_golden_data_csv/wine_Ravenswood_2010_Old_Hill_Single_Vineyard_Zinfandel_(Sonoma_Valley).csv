country: US.
description: The trick to a successful Zinfandel is to capture the grape's briary, brambly rusticity and lend it elegance and balance. This wine succeeds at that task. It's kind of a field blend with 25% of the wine made from what the winemaker calls “mixed blacks.” Whatever the varieties are, the wine is smooth, rich and delicious, showing complex wild berry, mocha, licorice, baking spice and sandalwood flavors. Should easily hold its own over the next 10 years..
