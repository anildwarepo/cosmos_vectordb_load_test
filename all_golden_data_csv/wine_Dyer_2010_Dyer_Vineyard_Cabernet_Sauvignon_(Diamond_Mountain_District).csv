country: US.
description: Showing precision craftsmanship, this wine hails from a tiny vineyard on Napa's famed Diamond Mountain. Only 225 cases were produced, but it's worth a search if you're looking for classic mountain Cabernet capable of extended aging. The wine has a linearity that defines elegance, yet is rich in blackberries and cassis, with oak nuances. Containing small quantities of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot for complexity, it will reward aging until at least 2018, and should be going strong in 2030..
