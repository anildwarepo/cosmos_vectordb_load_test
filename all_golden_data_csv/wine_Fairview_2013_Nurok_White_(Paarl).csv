country: South Africa.
description: There's a layered complexity to this interesting blend of 47% Viognier, 32% Chenin Blanc, 18% Roussanne and 3% Grenache Blanc, with a beautiful interplay between the fruity notes of citrus peel, tart melon, green apple and plum and the earthy tones of fynbos, almond skin and sweet baking spice. The plush texture is countered by ample acidity, leading into a clean finish that's laced with toasty accents. Drink nowâ€“2018..
