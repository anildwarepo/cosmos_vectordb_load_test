country: US.
description: In the world of rare, single-vineyard Oregon Pinots, this is a relative bargain. The vineyard adjoins the St. Innocent winery, in a prime Eola-Amity location. The fruit delivers the subtle complexity and detail you hope for but don't always find in single-vineyard bottles. Brambly and floral with subtle notes of violets, rose petals, cured meat, orange rind and more, it's a dense and thought-provoking wine that rewards close attention..
