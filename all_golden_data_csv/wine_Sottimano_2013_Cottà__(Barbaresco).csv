wine_Sottimano_2013_Cottà__(Barbaresco),"Unnamed: 0: 58507.
country: Italy.
description: You'll find alluring scents of black-skinned berry, baking spice, violet, a hint of leather and a balsamic note on this well-structured red. The chewy palate shows dense black cherry, raspberry compote, licorice, clove and pipe tobacco alongside velvety tannins and fresh acidity. A hint of cinnamon closes the finish. It's already approachable but also has great mid-term aging potential. Drink through 2023..
