country: US.
description: Walla Walla Vintners wines generally offer a sophisticated blend of vineyard sources and mixed varietals, and this Cab includes modest proportions of Merlot, Cab Franc, Carmenère, Malbec and Petit Verdot. It rounds out into a broadly flavorful bowl of chocolate-covered cherries, with a whiff of tobacco and forest coming through as well. Powerful and seductive, it will please those who love ripe black fruits and plenty of sweet and creamy new oak..
