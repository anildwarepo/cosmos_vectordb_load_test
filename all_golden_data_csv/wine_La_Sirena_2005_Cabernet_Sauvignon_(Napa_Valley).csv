country: US.
description: This dramatically structured Cab needs time in the cellar. It straddles the old-fashioned style of long-aging and the modern style of immediate opulence. The tannins star, sticky and firm, but the wine, which contains minor amounts of Merlot and Cabernet Franc, is so rich, so loaded in black currants, cherries, sweet ripe plums, chocolate, anise and smoky oak, that it seduces now. But best after the age of six..
