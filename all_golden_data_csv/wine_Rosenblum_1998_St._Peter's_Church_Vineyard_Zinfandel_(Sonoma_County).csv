wine_Rosenblum_1998_St._Peter's_Church_Vineyard_Zinfandel_(Sonoma_County),"Unnamed: 0: 27611.
country: US.
description: Inky, opaque and tight, this wine offers a bouquet of black fruits and toast. Though the mouthfeel is full and supple, it is presently very closed and yields scant flavor definition beyond the presence of a very good depth of dark fruits and well-charred oak. Finishes dry, with somewhat more discernable blackberry and vanilla notes and moderately puckering tannins. Best for keeping; try in two-plus years..
