wine_Margerum_2013_Black_Oak_Vineyard_Syrah_(Santa_Barbara_County),"Unnamed: 0: 77825.
country: US.
description: The nose on this bottling by Doug Margerum shows a strong herbal backbone against a dense fruit core on the nose, with dried sage, bay leaf, black currant, blackberry and wet-asphalt aromas. The tightly wound palate combines graphite, charred beef, elderberry, black pepper, asphalt and the slightest touch of vanilla bean. These components present tremendous potential for tertiary flavor development, so drink 2018â€“2028..
