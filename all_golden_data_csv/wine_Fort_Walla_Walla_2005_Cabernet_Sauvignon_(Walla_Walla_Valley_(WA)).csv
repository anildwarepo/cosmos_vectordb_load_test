country: US.
description: An excellent trio of vineyards—Minnick Hills, Pepper Bridge, and Alder Ridge—contribute to this substantial effort. The fruit is dense and lively, with spicy, tangy mixed berry, currant and cherry character. The tannins have been nicely polished, and the acids provide the underpinning that gives the wine its lift. Despite its power, the wine keeps the alcohol in check, without a trace of heat or burn..
