country: US.
description: This wine comes from a recently planted area of valley, high on a ridge top. A blend of 56% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Merlot, 6% Cabernet Franc and 6% Malbec, the aromas boast high-toned notes of mineral, herb, cherry, licorice and dark fruit. The cranberry and cherry flavors bring a sense of concentration and richness. It shows well now, but should only get better with some additional time in the bottle..
