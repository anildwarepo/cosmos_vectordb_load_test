country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: David Finlayson. Dense and concentrated, this is a powerful yet sexy wine that will please fans of ripely styled Cab Sauvs. Intense scents of blackberry, cassis, boysenberry, cigar box and spice cake dance in the glass and carry through to the bold, full-figured palate. The tannins are strong yet supple, with a texture like crushed velvet and additional notes of singed leather, tree bark, cigar and roasted espresso that unfold on the long finish. You can drink this now after some time to air or decanting, or try it after 2021 and through 2026..
