country: US.
description: Boheme follows up a successful 2009 vintage of this wine with a 2010 that's also quite good, although not perhaps as opulent. The color is translucent in ruby and garnet, suggesting the wine's delicacy. Grown in the Sebastopol part of the southwest valley, the wine brims in ripe, savory raspberries, persimmons and oak, with precocious acidity that makes the mouth water. Give it until 2018â€“2019 in the cellar..
