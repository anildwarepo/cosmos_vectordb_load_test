country: South Africa.
description: It's really a shame that only 25 cases of this wine were imported, as it's a fantastic Cab that's sure to compare favorably to some of your favorites. Black currant leaf, fennel, crushed violet and dried tobacco are intricately woven into the dark fruit aromas. The medium-weight mouth has a texture like crushed velvet, with firm tannins and assertive flavors of cassis, cigar and espresso that linger endlessly. Strong and a bit tight; try holding another 2â€“5 years..
