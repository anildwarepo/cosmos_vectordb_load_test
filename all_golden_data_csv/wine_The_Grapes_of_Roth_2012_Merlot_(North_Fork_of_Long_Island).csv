wine_The_Grapes_of_Roth_2012_Merlot_(North_Fork_of_Long_Island),"Unnamed: 0: 16513.
country: US.
description: Since its inception, WÃ¶lffer winemaker Roman Roth's namesake Merlot has been one of the best wines in Long Island. The 2012 bottling is no exception. It's a bold, densely fruity wine full of luscious black cherry, plum and currant flavors. Powerful yet finessed, it's keenly anchored by a core of cranberry acidity and complexities of bramble, violet and spice. Delicious already but sure to improve through at least 2030..
