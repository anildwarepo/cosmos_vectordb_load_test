country: Italy.
description: Here's a gorgeous Chianti Classico that shows great intensity, breeding and class. It opens with quintessential varietal aromas of leather, blue flower, berry and spice. The palate delivers juicy black cherry, white pepper, cinnamon and mint alongside bracing but refined tannins and fresh acidity. It already has compelling depth but is still young and needs time to develop even more complexity. Drink 2016–2030..
