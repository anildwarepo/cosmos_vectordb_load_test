country: Argentina.
description: Part of the fun of exploring Argentine Malbec is tasting all the new kids on the block. Having not seen Guentota before, all signs point to high quality. The bouquet is dark, with accents of cola, mineral and burnt toast giving it a masculine edge. Round, plump and full in the mouth, with cherry, berry and cassis flavors. A total package of a wine, with character, nuance and serious base-level fruit..
