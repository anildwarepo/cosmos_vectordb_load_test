country: US.
description: Best known for their red Bordeaux blend, Rubicon also produces small quantities of this Syrah, grown on the Rutherford estate. The wine is spectacular and immensely satisfying. Thoroughly dry, its tannins are front and center, but they are very finely ground, and frame enormously complex flavors of cassis, cherry jam, grilled meat, sweet leather, lavender, crushed pepper, smoky vanilla and cinnamon spice. Drink this fabulous wine now and through 2010..
