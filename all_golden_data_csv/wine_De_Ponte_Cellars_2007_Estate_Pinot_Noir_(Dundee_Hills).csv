country: US.
description: In 2007 the winery's Estate bottling seems to capture a bit more nuance and detail than the reserve, though admittedly it does not have quite the same concentration. For those who prize finesse, this is the wine of the vintage. Herbal and resiny, it's like sniffing a fine wine in a pine forest. It balances raspberry and sour cherry fruit with the tart and herbal “wild” side of Oregon Pinot. Penetrating and complex..
