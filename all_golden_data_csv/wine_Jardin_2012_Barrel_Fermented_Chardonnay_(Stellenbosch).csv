country: South Africa.
description: Despite being barrel fermented, this attractive white manages to maintain a vivid vibrancy and freshness, with notes of fresh red apple, firm peach, pineapple core, green mango and clementine that are all infused with delicate hints of toasted oak and baking spice. Ample acidity lifts the medium-weight palate and rich melon, apple and toasted brioche flavors, leading into the long, lingering wood-spiced finish..
