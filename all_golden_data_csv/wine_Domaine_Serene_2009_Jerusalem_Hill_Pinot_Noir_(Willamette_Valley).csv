country: US.
description: An early freeze shut down the vineyards in 2009, and produced wines that are less immediately generous than the ripe, fruit-driven 2008s. The vanilla wafer aromas from barrel aging show prominently here, with the wild berry fruit being tart and so compact as to be almost invisible at first. But patience is rewarded, as the wine fills in gracefully with nuanced notes of herb and dried leaf, as well as balanced acids..
