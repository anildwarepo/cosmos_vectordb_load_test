country: US.
description: Made from selected barrels of the winery's various vineyard sources, this bottling is one of the more powerful Zinfandels out there. It's concentrated in blackberries, cherries, currants and oak, with wonderfully complicating notes of grilled meat, black pepper, violets and mu shu plum sauce. The wine will undoubtedly age for many years, gradually shedding primary fruit and picking up sweeter notes..
