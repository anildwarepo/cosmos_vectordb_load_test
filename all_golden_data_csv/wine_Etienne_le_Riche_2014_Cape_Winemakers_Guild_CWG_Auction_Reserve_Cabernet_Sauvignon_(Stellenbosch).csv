country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Etienne le Riche. There are layers of aromas and flavors in this complex wine, starting with attractive scents of pressed purple flowers, wild strawberries, blackberries and woodspice. The palate is seriously spicy, but grounded by dense—yet not overdone—black fruit flavors. Medium acidity and structured tannins, followed by a long, evolving finish, complete the package. Harmonious, well integrated and balanced, drink 2020–2024..
