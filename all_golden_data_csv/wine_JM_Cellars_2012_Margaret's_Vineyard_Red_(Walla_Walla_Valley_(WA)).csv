description: This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (50%), Merlot (25%), Cabernet Franc (10%), Malbec (10%) and Petit Verdot comes from the winery's young estate vineyard. Aromas of vanilla bean, dried herb, licorice, cranberry and cherry are brooding. The palate offers focused yet restrained fruit flavors and well-balanced acid and tannin.
