country: Austria.
description: Sumptuous oak flavors of cinnamon, blueberry notes and spicy pepper make for an impressive olfactory trio. The palate comes across as velvety but fresh, echoing these same flavors, emphasizing pepper and blueberry. The structure is big and bold and fully supported by oak, but the crunchy fruit freshness holds the balance. This has a fruity finish and would need some hearty meat to be drunk now. Otherwise drink 2019–2029..
