country: US.
description: While this vineyard is close by the Russian River and is not considered the best of Rochioli's vineyards, winemaker Bob Cabral consistently makes its grapes into one of Williams Selyem's most compelling wines. This shows the impeccable tannins and acids of Rochioli fruit, with sweet, ripe, deep flavors of cherry and spice. Notes of pomegranate, rum punch, dark chocolate and smoky sandalwood add complexity. Beautiful to drink now, it should continue to develop for at least 10 years..
