country: Italy.
description: Fast becoming one of the world's top luxury cuv√©es, this blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 10% Syrah is a complex amalgam of dry, classy fruit, herbal notes, smoked meat, black pepper and baking spices. Its calling card is its perfect body weight. It isn't heavy or jammy, but it manages to offer tons of stuffing and a graceful finish loaded with the essences of cola, coffee and chocolate. If possible, it should be cellared for several more years..
