wine_Wolfberger_2014_Rangen_Grand_Cru_Riesling_(Alsace),"Unnamed: 0: 27342.
country: France.
description: The scent of fresh fragrant orange peel has a totally honeyed edge on the nose. The palate, however, has a wonderfully clear and clean-cut green pear and lemon note that simply sings. There is concentration and poise but also a feeling that this might be far better with a few years of cellar age. The beautifully dry palate is concentrated and has impact but is not heavy; the finish is lip-smacking and vivid. It's lovely now but better later. Drink 2017–2030..
