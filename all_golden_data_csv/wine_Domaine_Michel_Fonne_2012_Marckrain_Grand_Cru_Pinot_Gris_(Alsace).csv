description: Superripe mirabelles and the juiciest pears appear on the nose and fill the mind with heady perfume. The palate confirms this notion of sweetness with ample residual sugar. However, this is met with precise acidity to create unusual thrill. This just sits on a knife's edge between juicy ripe pear and mouth-watering grapefruit zest—a wonderful interplay of notions that makes this incredibly enticing. This is starting to develop and has way to go with its playful, medium-dry finish. Drink 2017–2030..
