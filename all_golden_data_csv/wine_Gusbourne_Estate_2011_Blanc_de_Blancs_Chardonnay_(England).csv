wine_Gusbourne_Estate_2011_Blanc_de_Blancs_Chardonnay_(England),"Unnamed: 0: 124898.
country: England.
description: Creaminess and stone are all that is signalled on the nose. The palate opens with a generous spirit that unites green apple crispness, lemon freshness, shortbread richness and chalky depth. There is an undertow of lemon oil and lasting length. There is something generous and rounded about this wine that does not stem from dosage. Intriguing, wonderfully dry, grown-up and totally lasting. This is still taut and will gain from bottle age..
