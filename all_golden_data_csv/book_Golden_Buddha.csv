Description: The author of the bestselling Dirk Pitt novels introduces us to a thrilling new high seas action hero: Juan Cabrillo. Skipper of a non-descript lumber hauler disguising a state of the art spy ship behind the hull, Cabrillo takes the helm on dangerous covert missions carried out for whatever U.S. agency pays the price. And the stakes have never been higher - Cabrillo and his crew must put Tibet back in the hands of the Delai Lama by striking a deal with the Russians and the Chinese. His gambling chip is a golden Buddha containing records of vast oil reserves in the disputed land. But first, he has to locate and seize the artefact.
