country: Italy.
description: Made entirely of Pinot Nero, this elegant, structured sparkler opens with aromas of rose, berry and yeasty sensations of freshly baked butter cookies. The palate delivers a nice depth of flavors including tart red apple, wild strawberry, sage and marjoram alongside brisk acidity and an elegant, persistent mousse. It's already delicious but will also age well over the next few years. Drink through 2019..
