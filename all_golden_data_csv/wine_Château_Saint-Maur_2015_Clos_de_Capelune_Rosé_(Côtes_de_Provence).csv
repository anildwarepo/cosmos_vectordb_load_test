country: France.
description: From a 29-acre property separate from the estate, this wine, made by the Saint-Maur team, benefits from the cool, 1,200-foot elevation that bestows a crisp, elegant character. It comes in an overweight statement bottle, four inches across at the base. Fortunately the wine is delicious, lightly perfumed and full of tantalizing white-peach flavors with a mineral structure that comes from schist soil. Age for a few more months and drink from late 2016..
