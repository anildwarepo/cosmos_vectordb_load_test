country: US.
description: No, that's not a typo. The ??? Vineyard bottling conceals (intentionally) the fruit sources for these grapes, which come from one of Oregon's most expensive and highly-reviewed producers. It's crystal-clear in both appearance and flavor, building upon a cranberry/raspberry base into a potent young wine with expressive purity. A streak of gun metal, often found in consulting winemaker Robert Brittan's own wines, adds a stylish note to the finish..
