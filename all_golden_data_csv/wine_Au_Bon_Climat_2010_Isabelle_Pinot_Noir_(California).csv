wine_Au_Bon_Climat_2010_Isabelle_Pinot_Noir_(California),"Unnamed: 0: 54865.
country: US.
description: The California appellation is because this Pinot is a blend of vineyards from Anderson Valley, Russian River Valley and the Central Coast. Few vintners dare to take such an approach, especially with so expensive a wine, but Jim Clendenen succeeds wildly. The wine is bone dry, low in alcohol and tart in acidity, with crazily complex flavors of cherries, cranberries, pomegranates, cola, orange peel and spices. The balance is great, and testifies to a mastery of the art of blending..
