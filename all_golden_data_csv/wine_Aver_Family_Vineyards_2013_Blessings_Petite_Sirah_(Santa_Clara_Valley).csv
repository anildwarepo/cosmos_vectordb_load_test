country: US.
description: This is a strong showing for this growing region south of San Jose, which was historically home to prominent vineyards. Crushed black peppercorns, thyme and rosemary show on the nose against tart blackberry juice, with cola and a touch of blackened beef. Black currant and elderberry arise on the sip along with white-pepper spice, held together by balanced acidity and tannins. It's ripe, but far from overdone..
