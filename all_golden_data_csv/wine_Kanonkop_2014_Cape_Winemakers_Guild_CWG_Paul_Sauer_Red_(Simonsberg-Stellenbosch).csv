country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Abrie Beeslaar. Always a stunner, in both regular release as well as the CWG form, Kanonkop's Paul Sauer Bordeaux-style blend is bold and concentrated, with tremendous potential for long-term aging. Made from 74% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot and 9% Cabernet Franc, it's brimming with notes of cassis, licorice root and black-fruit preserves, all buoyed by ample acidity and a pronounced mentholated-herb lift. Bittersweet cocoa, char and chicory unfold on the back of the black fruit-skin fueled finish. Robust, full and firm, drink 2020â€“2026..
