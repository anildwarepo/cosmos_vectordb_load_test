country: US.
description: Here's one for the cellar, not just because the tannins are so aggressive, but because the wine is so balanced. With alcohol only 13.8%, it's dry and rich in black currant fruit, almost a throwback to the Napa Cabernets of old that aged so well. It possesses a dry, elegant sophistication that stands in deliberate contrast to today's gooey, sweet style. Best 2009–2015, if not longer, with proper cellaring..
