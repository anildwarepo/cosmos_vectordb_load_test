wine_Alta_Maria_2013_Carbonic_Pinot_Noir_(Santa_Maria_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 96328.
country: US.
description: A fascinating wine, it was processed in a carbonic fashion, in which the juice is allowed to ferment inside the mostly intact grape skins, much like what's done in Beaujolais. The result is a transparent, ruby red wine that offers scents of a dust storm mixed with crushed rock and chile pepper herbaciousness. It's warm and soft on the mouth with a presence that suggests something between peppercorns and bell peppers..
