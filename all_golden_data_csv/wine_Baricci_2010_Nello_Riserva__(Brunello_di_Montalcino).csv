wine_Baricci_2010_Nello_Riserva__(Brunello_di_Montalcino),"Unnamed: 0: 45783.
country: Italy.
description: New leather, mature black-skinned fruit, tilled soil and a touch of dark spice are some of the aromas you'll find on this fantastic, full-bodied red. The big, velvety palate shows power and finesse, offering mouthfuls of juicy wild cherry, black raspberry, licorice, Mediterranean herb and a note of exotic spice framed in firm, ripe tannins. It's already balanced and delicious, but hold for more complexity. Drink 2020–2035..
