country: US.
description: A best-of-barrels blend from the classic Bordeaux varieties, this wine is delicious. It's not hard for Napa to ripen fruit to blackberry and cherry perfection, or for the winemaker to age the wine in the best oak. What's difficult is to house all this richness in such smooth tannins, with such depth and such a pure finish. A spectacularly good wine to drink now, and it should develop for at least a decade..
