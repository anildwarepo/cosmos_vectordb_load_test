Description: Three seemingly unrelated events occur on a single morning in London. An MP wakes up after spending the night with a beautiful young woman. A tycoon meets a leading Bank of England official for breakfast. And an underworld gang boss briefs his crew. Nothing so far to keep the tabloid editors awake. Until ambitious young reporter Kevin Hart uncovers his first promising link... Because what is at stake is conspiracy: conspiracy to defraud, no matter what the human cost. On one unforgettable day in the world's financial capital, fortunes will be destroyed and ideals will be shattered by the discovery that the whole truth is too dangerous to print....
