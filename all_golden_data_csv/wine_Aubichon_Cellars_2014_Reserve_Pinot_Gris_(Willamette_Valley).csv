country: US.
description: Quite distinct from the winery's regular Pinot Gris, this is oak fermented and barrel aged on the lees for 16 months. The hock bottle suggests an Alsatian model, the extended barrel time softening the sharp acidity. There's a light suggestion of wood flavor, not toast but neutral wood, and the fruit is damped down. However, with extra aeration this wine springs to life, with complex highlights of wood, herb and stone..
