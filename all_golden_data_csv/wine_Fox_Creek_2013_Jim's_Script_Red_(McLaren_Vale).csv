wine_Fox_Creek_2013_Jim's_Script_Red_(McLaren_Vale),"Unnamed: 0: 76714.
country: Australia.
description: This blended red brings in four of the five Bordeaux varieties (61% Cabernet Sauvignon, 27% Merlot, 8% Cabernet Franc, 4% Petit Verdot). Some prominent mint notes may limit its appeal, but it's otherwise a classic example of the genre, accenting cassis fruit with hints of vanilla and cedar. Despite the ample alcohol and a bit of warmth, there's also some austerity and firmness to the tannins. Drink 2018â€“2025..
