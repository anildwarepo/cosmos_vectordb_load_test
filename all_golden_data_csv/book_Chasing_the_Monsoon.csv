Description: In 1987 Frater was able to realize his dream of witnessing firsthand the most dramatic of meteorological events: the Indian monsoon. He followed it from its ""burst"" on the beaches of Trivandrum, through Delhi, Calcutta and across Bangladesh. The result is an illumination of the towering influence of nature over the lives and culture of India and her people..
