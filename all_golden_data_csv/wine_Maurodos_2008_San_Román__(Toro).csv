wine_Maurodos_2008_San_Román__(Toro),"Unnamed: 0: 5007.
country: Spain.
description: One of Spain's great full-force, modern-style wines, this excels despite the marginal 2008 vintage. It's open-knit and soft on the nose, with ladels of spice, graphite and black fruit aromas. It feels fresh, balanced and not overly tannic, with strapping blackberry, coffee, chocolate, spice and tobacco flavors all rolled into a fabulous whole. Licorice, espresso and amaro notes grace the padded finish. Drink now–2018..
