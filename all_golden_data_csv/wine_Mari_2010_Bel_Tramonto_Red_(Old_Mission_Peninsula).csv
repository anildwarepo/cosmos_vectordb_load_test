wine_Mari_2010_Bel_Tramonto_Red_(Old_Mission_Peninsula),"Unnamed: 0: 126646.
country: US.
description: This is a contemplative blend of Merlot and Sangiovese, the latter being an atypical grape for the region. Using the winery's trademarked Nellaserra greenhouse system, this wine has found warmer-climate ripeness in the cool climes of northern Michigan. Blending characteristics of both grapes, black raspberry, cherry and plum meet savory herb and game tones on the nose and palate. Round in feel and nicely balanced, think of this as a softer, Americanized Super Tuscan..
