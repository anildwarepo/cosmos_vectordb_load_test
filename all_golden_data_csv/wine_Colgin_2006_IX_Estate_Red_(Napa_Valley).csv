country: US.
description: From the estate, in the Pritchard Hill area of St. Helena which is worthy of its own appellation, comes this densely structured, impressive but young wine. It's massive in fruity extract and new oak, flooding the mouth with soft, ultrarich flavors of blackberries and dark chocolate and a leathery, peppery, grilled meat quality. This is the kind of wine even a non-red wine drinker will be dazzled by, and connoisseurs will appreciate its power and finesse. Ready now for sheer opulence, and should develop through 2012, at least..
