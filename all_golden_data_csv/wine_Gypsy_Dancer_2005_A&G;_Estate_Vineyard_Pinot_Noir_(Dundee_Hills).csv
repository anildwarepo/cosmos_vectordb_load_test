country: US.
description: My favorite of the 2005 releases from Gypsy Dancer, this is a complex wine that seems to be holding back, like a fine race horse at the starting gate. It's got the concentrated core of cherry fruit, which leads into mixed berries, toast, spice and more. A light earthy streak supports notes of root and soil, and the midpalate is a bit subdued, but the flavors come roaring back at the end, gaining strength and suggesting that this is a wine to cellar for some years..
