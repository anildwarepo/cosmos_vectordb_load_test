country: France.
description: Yeasty funk still dominates the nose and only lets a touch of lemon zest through. The palate continues with the zesty background against which flashes of riper fruit appear: juicy pear and luscious tangerine. The fruit expression is ripe but utterly fresh. The taut dry palate is anchored in something cool and fresh, something that expands as texture and fills not only the palate but also the mind. This is fresh and luminous, elegant and fine boned. Drink now through 2030..
