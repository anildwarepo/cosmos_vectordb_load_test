country: US.
description: The intriguing golden-pink color looks like sun shining through a rose petal, and the aromas of honey, buttered popcorn and pecan pie are just as appealing. Once sipped, the flavors of poached salmon somehow show. These continue into a long finish, although the acidity soon wipes the slate clean like a good rosé should. This is one of many wines made by ninth-generation Santa Maria Valleyite James Ontiveros..
