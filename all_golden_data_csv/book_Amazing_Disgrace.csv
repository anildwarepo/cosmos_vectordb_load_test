Description: In this sequel to the popular Cooking with Fernet Branca, Gerald Samper is back on his Tuscan hilltop and busily musing on the absurdities of modern life. His entertaining asides - on everything from publishing to penile implants, celebrity sportswomen to Australian media moguls - and his eccentric recipes form the comic heart of this literary romp. Marta, Gerald's nemesis in Cooking with Fernet Branca, is back, along with her penchant for the eponymous potent liquor and her talent for shattering Gerald's evening idylls. But she's not alone: Amazing Disgrace touts a cavalcade of memorable characters, including a foul-mouthed, one-armed yachtswoman, and sees Gerald jettisoned from his Tuscan hideaway into the trendy haunts of his native London..
