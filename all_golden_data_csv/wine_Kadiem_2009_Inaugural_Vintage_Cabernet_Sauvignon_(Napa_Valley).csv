country: US.
description: This is a really impressive launch for this new brand. Although the bottle doesn't bear a vineyard designation, it's 100% Cabernet from the Morisoli Vineyard in Rutherford, which has produced superb Cabernets in the past from the likes of Meander, Galleron, V. Sattui and Sequoia Grove. Dry and full bodied, it has flavors of sour cherry candy and cassis that often define Rutherford, which are all wrapped into smooth, supple tannins. Beautiful as it is now, it's a wine you want to lay down. Best after 2017..
