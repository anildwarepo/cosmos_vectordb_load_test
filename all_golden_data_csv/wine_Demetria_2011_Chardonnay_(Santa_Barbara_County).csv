wine_Demetria_2011_Chardonnay_(Santa_Barbara_County),"Unnamed: 0: 10013.
country: US.
description: This eccentric Chard marches to its own beat. It's drier and more acidic than most, and the flavors offer a m√©lange of peaches, oranges, tropical fruits, Meyer lemons, cashews and white flowers. Yet it's delicious and compelling. Made with full-throttle techniques that include partial barrel fermentation, malolactic fermentation and battonage, it was bottled unfined and unfiltered. The vineyards are Sierra Madre, in the Santa Maria Valley, and Oaks Savannah, in the Santa Ynez Valley..
