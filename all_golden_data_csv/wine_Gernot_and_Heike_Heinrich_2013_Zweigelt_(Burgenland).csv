country: Austria.
description: Faint but appetizing notes of crunchy, red cherry are joined by white pepper on the vivacious nose. This is a serious red, but by no means a heavy one. With its supple, soft but palpable tannins, as well as unashamed fresh cherry and spicy depth, this is an elegant, honest and beautiful rendition of Zweigelt. Medium bodied, it shows the elegant, spicy side of the variety without denying its lively, cherry-laden appeal..
