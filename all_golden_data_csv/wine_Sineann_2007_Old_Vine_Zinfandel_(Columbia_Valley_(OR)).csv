wine_Sineann_2007_Old_Vine_Zinfandel_(Columbia_Valley_(OR)),"Unnamed: 0: 129142.
country: US.
description: Tight, earthy, spiced up with leaf and pepper, this old vine Zin gathers strength in the mid-palate and displays a perfect blend of sweet cherry, berry and some finishing tomato leaf. This 2007 seems a bit less ripe than previous efforts, so the fruit does not have the same sweetness, but the winemaking is exceptional and the flavors are woven beautifully. These 2007s may yet prove to be among the most ageworthy wines that Sineann has ever made..
