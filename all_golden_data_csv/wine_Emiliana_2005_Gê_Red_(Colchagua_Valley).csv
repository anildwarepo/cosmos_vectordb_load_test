country: Chile.
description: All signs point in one direction: the top of the heap. This is one great Chilean red blend! With Syrah, Carmenère, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in the mix, Gê sets a new benchmark for multigrape blends from Chile. This wine is loaded with berry, cassis and black plum flavors, but it's textured, balanced and alluring. There's a bit of creaminess on the finish to offset any tannic bite that's still holding on, but as a whole it's delicious, generous and ready to go. Best now through 2011..
