country: US.
description: Entrepreneur Roger Bower hired Harlan Estate alum Adam Henkel to deliver top-tier wines, and this first release is an extremely auspicious beginning. Black as night in the glass, the wine delivers elegant aromas of olallieberry jam, baking spice, shaved chocolate, beef jerky, teriyaki and purple flowers. The sticky structure will age phenomenally, further concentrating flavors of coffee foam, soy-laced berry sauce, Asian pepper spice, and dense blueberry, black cassis and black plum fruit. Drink 2018â€“2033..
