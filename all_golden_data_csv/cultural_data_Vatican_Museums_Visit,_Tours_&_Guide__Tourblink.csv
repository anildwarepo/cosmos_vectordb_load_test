The information in the app is concise, useful, fun and easy to understand. The one related to the artworks is free!

So that when you leave the museum, you leave it with a good taste of knowledge.ITINERARIESDon't you exactly know how to profit your time? Where to start? We are here to solve that! We propose itineraries by hours, in order to enjoy the museum as much as you can! You will feel like on a tour, but on your own and at your own pace. Once you choose one of the itineraries (paying a ridiculous price of less than € 5), you can follow the route and listen to the audio guides, which will give you information to understand what you see once you are in front of it. Or if you prefer, you can read it.Read moreCollapse.

But half of the paintings have been removed and switched to others and the number of audio files is really low (about a dozen). I bought the 120 min tour: Best of the Valican Museums that really needs an update. The voice is also very mechanical (synthetic voice). Not a very comprehensive experience. Does give a little more info on some exhibits but only offers a total of 20. The museum has 1000s. The app offers paid ""itineraries"" for free if you give 5 stars hence the great rating.

Does give a little more info on some exhibits but only offers a total of 20. The museum has 1000s. The app offers paid ""itineraries"" for free if you give 5 stars hence the great rating. The idea of guiding you through is good but with so few exhibits it adds very little value to the trip. Great app, great tour. We bought the spoken tour. Very clear route through the museum Only minor issue was with one exhibit the voiceover stopped after 5 second. Rest was perfect! Nice audio guide and itineraries to follow. Cheaper than the museum guide and only the main. Perfect! Tip: take your.tickets.in advance.
