country: US.
description: This is 100% new oak (primarily Taransaud, 32 months), and it's a marvelous example of the grape, the vineyard and the strengths of Washington fruit. The Shafer Hillside Select is the inspiration for the extended barrel aging and the focus on round, sweet tannins. This is a tight wine, with a lovely purity of fruit that captures the cassis, the black cherry, the subtle herbal character of the Cabernet grape. This is from the oldest block in the vineyard—now eight -year-old vines..
