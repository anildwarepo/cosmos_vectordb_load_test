description: Made from a slightly smaller percentage (81%) of estate fruit, with the intention of being approachable earlier, this wine has 19% blended in from Oakville Ranch, Knightsbridge and Young Inglewood, including 2% each of Malbec and Cabernet Franc. It jumps from the glass with yeasty black and red berry, a leathery, velvety mouthfeel and a fist of black pepper. Delicious now it should also age well, intense but bright in acidity..
