country: Spain.
description: The price on this high-flying Rioja continues to go through the roof, and so does the oak and tannin. And while we still appreciate the wine's intensity and power, this vintage pushes so much espresso, burnt nut and rubber that it probably won't impress all comers. In the mouth, look for dark, almost bitter black-fruit flavors followed by a firm, tannic finish. Needs time in the cellar to find more integration. Hold for another year before checking on its status..
