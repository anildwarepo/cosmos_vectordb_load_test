country: Israel.
description: Inky garnet to the eye, this wine features aromas of cherry and strawberry with a strong dose of violet. Although it has strong flavors of lightly cooked woodland fruits (including notes of vanilla, brambles and soft citrus) it is bright and retains a grip on the palate from start to finish. Lasting tannins are ever present yet not overpowering. The finish is characterized by flavors of tangerine and baking spices..
