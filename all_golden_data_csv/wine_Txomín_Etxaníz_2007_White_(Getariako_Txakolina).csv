wine_Txomín_Etxaníz_2007_White_(Getariako_Txakolina),"Unnamed: 0: 120667.
country: Spain.
description: Nobody should mistake this idiosyncratic Basque white wine for a bargain. At $25, you had better like steely, almost sour-style whites to justify going here. But if you can find the pleasure in Txakoli, then this one is good. It has peach and nectarine aromas, which are backed by tangy lemon and pineapple flavors. Naturally sharp and cleansing on the finish, and thus good for seafood tapas and the like..
