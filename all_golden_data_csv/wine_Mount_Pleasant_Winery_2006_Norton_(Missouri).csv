country: US.
description: Ambitious and concentrated, with an inky color and a juicy, mouthwatering palate framed by mature blackberry and raspberry fruit. A pronounced char note on the nose follows through to a medium, slightly tart finish. Try with barbecued pork belly. Already showing signs of earthy maturity, this wine is unlikely to benefit from further aging though the firm acid will allow it to keep another year or two..
