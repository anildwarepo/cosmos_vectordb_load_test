country: US.
description: Trisaetum produces both a dry and an off-dry cuvée from each of its three estate vineyards, as well as two versions of an Estates Reserve. Richer and bigger overall than the individual cuvées, this dry bottling is smooth and round, with a palate-pleasing blend of citrus flesh and peel, notably orange. There's tangerine and spice as well, and the wine continues bright and long through a most engaging finish..
