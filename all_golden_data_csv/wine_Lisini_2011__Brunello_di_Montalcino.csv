wine_Lisini_2011__Brunello_di_Montalcino,"Unnamed: 0: 44596.
country: Italy.
description: Intense, lovely aromatics of wild berry, fragrant blue flower, crushed herb and a whiff of tilled soil lead the way. On the powerful palate, youthfully assertive but refined tannins frame layers of crushed black cherry, blackberry, mint and ground pepper while a licorice note closes the lingering finish. Boasting structure and finesse, it shows surprising aging potential for the vintage. Drink 2020–2031..
