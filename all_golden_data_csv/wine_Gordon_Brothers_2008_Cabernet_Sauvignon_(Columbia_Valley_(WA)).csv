country: US.
description: All estate-grown, this beautifully crafted Cabernet is a fine expression of Columbia Valley fruit. It's lifted with juicy berry and black cherry flavors, then expanded with notes of cola, earth, leaf, herb and roasted coffee. Everything is in proportion, and the overall impression is of balance and elegance; depth without excess. It's a style of Cabernet that may have fallen out of favor, but shows exceptional grape growing and winemaking skills..
