country: US.
description: Ron Lachini cleverly assigns his wines to a carefully assembled team of winemakers; this one belongs to Laurent Montalieu. It is the estate reserve, from low-yielding vines. It is a particular success in this much-maligned vintage. Intense and focused, it opens with pungent aromas of forest and clove, tastes of concentrated cranberry and pomegranate fruit, and powers through into a full-bodied, hefty, assertive finish. The tannins are substantial and the winemaking perfect..
