country: Italy.
description: Aldegheri, one of the most important producers in Valpolicella, has released a 17-year-old wine that has spent eight years in large oak casks and the rest in bottle. This fascinating expression offers a glimpse of Amarone history, but does so with elegance and grace. With the fruity sweetness long gone, this now boasts a tight, linear mineral note and dusty aromas of candied fruit, licorice, cola and smoke..
