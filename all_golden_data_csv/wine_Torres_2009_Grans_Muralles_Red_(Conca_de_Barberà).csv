country: Spain.
description: Heady aromas of blackberry, licorice, raisin and prune are at max ripeness but don't go overboard. That's the theme of this Catalan blend of known and local grapes including Carignan and Garnacha. Bold yet bright on the palate, this deals a full-throttle, toasty mix of root beer, mocha and blackberry flavors. Additional notes of chocolate, toast and spice drive the finish and complete the package. Drink through 2023..
