unesco_heritage_Site_of_Xanadu,"Name: Site of Xanadu.
short_description: <p>North of the Great Wall, the Site of Xanadu encompasses the remains of Kublai Khan&rsquo;s legendary capital city, designed by the Mongol ruler&rsquo;s Chinese advisor Liu Bingzhdong in 1256. Over a surface area of 25,000&nbsp;ha, the site was a unique attempt to assimilate the nomadic Mongolian and Han Chinese cultures. From this base, Kublai Khan established the Yuan dynasty that ruled China over a century, extending its boundaries across Asia. The religious debate that took place here resulted in the dissemination of Tibetan Buddhism over north-east Asia, a cultural and religious tradition still practised in many areas today. The site was planned according to traditional Chinese <em>feng shui</em> in relation to the nearby mountains and river. It features the remains of the city, including temples, palaces, tombs, nomadic encampments and the Tiefan&rsquo;gang Canal, along with other waterworks.</p>.
