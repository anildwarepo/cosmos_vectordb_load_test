wine_Ca'_Marcanda_2010_Camarcanda__(Bolgheri),"Unnamed: 0: 47359.
country: Italy.
description: Made by Angelo Gaja at his estate in coastal Tuscany, this blend of 50% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc leads with aromas of plum, spice and warm toasted notes. The structured, elegant palate delivers restrained black currant and black cherry accented with notes of black pepper and coffee alongside polished tannins. It's still young and a bit nervous, so give it time to develop its potential. Drink 2015–2030..
