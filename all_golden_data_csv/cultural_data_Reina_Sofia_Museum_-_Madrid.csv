Some works are not in the places as  described (due to temporary exhibits) but otherwise this app gives a  fantastic background to the Reina Sofia collection. Rothko is missed but  hey you know where you to find one! Sal 406! Cheap & useful This is a great audio tour for the museum - better than most museum audio guides.

Instead of just talking about individual works it also talked about why a room of art was together.  Also had a suggested sequence, which worked well. I have a much better understanding of Spanish modern art than i would have otherwise. Useless The app idea is really good, the content seems interresting, but there is no pictures of the painting discussed, instead we are presented with the photo of the painter.

So it was impossible to understand what the discussion is about. I got fed up and wished I took the audio guide from the museum. With just this small finetuning the app would be amazing. Great idea, niggles in execution Great idea and use of technology. Using a device most people are already carrying to deliver audio commentary rather than hiring a separate physical device widens the base of users, reduces cost and price, and allows richer AV content to be provided.

Using a device most people are already carrying to deliver audio commentary rather than hiring a separate physical device widens the base of users, reduces cost and price, and allows richer AV content to be provided. One star removed for some niggles: commentary cut off sometimes a few seconds before the end, a few listings were not up to date with current hanging. Also, coverage was quite sparse for floor 4, and non - existent for the most recent works in the new building.
