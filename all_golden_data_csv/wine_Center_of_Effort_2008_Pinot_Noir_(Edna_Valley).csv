country: US.
description: One of the best Edna Valley Pinot Noirs ever. This region normally produces Pinots with crisp acidity and fine varietal character, and so it is here, with its cherry, black raspberry, red currant and sandalwood flavors. But there's extra depth and complexity, with a wildly exotic, spicy edge, that lift the wine into greatness. Right up there with the best of coastal California. Hard to tell where it's going, but give it a good decant before serving..
