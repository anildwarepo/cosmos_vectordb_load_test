wine_Chehalem_2005_Reserve_Pinot_Noir_(Willamette_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 65488.
country: US.
description: The goal here, says the winery, is to craft a wine that embodies the essence of Pinot Noir. Whatever that means, this is their priciest Pinot and the one that they have designated Reserve. It's got bulk and power, and I like the way it gathers strength in the mid-palate and on through the finish. It has pretty cherry fruit and good concentration; it does not have the textural detail of the single vineyard Corral Creek..
