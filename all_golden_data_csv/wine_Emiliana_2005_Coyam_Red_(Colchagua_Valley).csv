country: Chile.
description: Emiliana began as Vinedos Organicos Emiliana, but now goes only by Emiliana because getting certified as an organic winery proved too difficult. Still, Emiliana's vineyards are organically farmed, and this five-grape blend made by Alvaro Espinoza is intense and extracted yet still finely knit. It's a serious wine with slight herbal/pine aromas, robust red-fruit flavors, and a smooth, stylish finish. Not overdone, so drink now..
