country: France.
description: Subtle but luscious notes of Mirabelle plum, ripe greengage and peach lend a seductive touch to this taut, structured and beautifully textured wine whose palate is reminiscent of bot fresh apple peel and grapefruit zest. Covers of fruit are tautly spread across spokes of acidity, creating a wonderful tension that keeps you wanting more. Authentic in its appeal, it's delicious now but will drink well until at least 2025..
