country: Italy.
description: Aromas of dark berry steeped in spirits, baking spice, crushed flower, mocha, eucalyptus and pipe tobacco come together on this stunning wine. The firm palate boasts more fruit than many from this vintage, delivering juicy dark cherry, ripe raspberry, vanilla, cake spice and licorice alongside firm but refined tannins and bright acidity. It's youthfully assertive but balanced, with serious aging potential. Drink 2021–2041..
