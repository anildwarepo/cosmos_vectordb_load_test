wine_Center_of_Effort_2012_Chardonnay_(Edna_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 28101.
country: US.
description: This phenomenal bottling from the winemaking team of Mike Sinor and Nathan Carlson hits the nose with a judicious touch of vanilla-laced buttercream as well as scorched lemon slices and orange peels. It's playfully lithe on the palate, with just a touch of oak warmth, racy acidity, chalky grip and a faint hint of dill. It's great for now, but will age with nutty style thanks to the balancing tensions..
