country: US.
description: Naggiar makes at least 15 wines from its estate vineyard, and really hit a home run with this classic that should have a long life ahead of it. The color is dark and intense right to the rim, while aromas blend a subtle spiciness with bold and complex fruit notes. Flavors convey concentrated dark chocolate, black cherry and espresso. It's enjoyable now with big proteins, but will be best after 2020..
