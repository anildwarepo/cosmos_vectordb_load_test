country: US.
description: The deep, almost tawny gold color, coupled with a slight pétillance, signals that this is no ordinary GV. It went through four days of whole cluster maceration before being fermented with wild yeasts in new 500-liter Austrian oak puncheons. It's rich, toasty and lively in the mouth, yet smoothed out with the oxidative impact of the time in wood. A generous and flavorful wine, it shows toast and nuts and caramelized highlights along with light apple-butter fruit..
