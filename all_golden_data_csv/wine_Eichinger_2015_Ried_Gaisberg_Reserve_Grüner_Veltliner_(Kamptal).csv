country: Austria.
description: A wonderfully intense nose speaks of yarrow and moss, mirabelle plums and lifted, invigorating freshness. The palate fizzes away with flavor and excitement. This is a very lively, concentrated wine that flirts with us right now but has its real treasure of fruit still buried in its deep core. This will blossom with bottle age: Right now, the zesty tangerine peel flavors merely hint at the pleasures to come. Drink 2020–2030..
