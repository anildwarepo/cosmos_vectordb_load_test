country: France.
description: A very lifted touch of fir honey hits the nose first before ripe peach with the merest touch of vanilla follow. The palate is incisive and concentrated. Alcoholic heat fires up the mellow, rich and rounded palate that brims with peachy fruit and flavor while zesty lemon oil hints illuminate and brighten the richness. This seems to have only just started on its trajectory. It is ready to drink but it will evolve much further, becoming ever more itself. The finish is just off dry and very long with lemon zest and peach. Drink 2017–2037..
