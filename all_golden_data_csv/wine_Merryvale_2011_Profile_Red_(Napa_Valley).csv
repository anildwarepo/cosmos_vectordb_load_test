country: US.
description: The winery's top-end Bordeaux red, this blends 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Cabernet Franc, 19% Petit Verdot and 15% Malbec. The fruit is sourced from the family's estate vineyard on the eastern slopes of the Napa Valley, then aged 20 months in French oak, 90% of it new. Black in color, it tastes of cedar and smoke, with soft layers of subtle plum and cassis before a grippy finish. Enjoy through 2021..
