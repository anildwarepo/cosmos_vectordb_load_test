country: France.
description: A mellow touch of ripe Red Delicious apple hovers on the nose. The palate brims with rich fruit, showing candied pear and dried apple. This richness is countered by a pleasantly bitter phenolic edge and a pure streak of fresh zestiness. A touch of sandalwood and cinnamon adds spice around the edges. While this is attractive now, it will reward cellaring as far more interesting notes of spice and fruit are sure to develop. Drink 2020–2030..
