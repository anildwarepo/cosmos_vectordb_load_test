country: Austria.
description: Rich glints of ripe passion fruit are burgeoning on the nose. The palate has the same richness but is kept in check by wonderfully insisting, bright lemon acidity that suggests both peel and flesh. This is not really fully sweet and thus occupies an uncertain field—one which clever and innovative cooks navigate with aplomb. This is a wine for spiced, exotic dishes that involve fruit, for soft, ripe cheeses or savory fruit combos. The wine's creamy finish pulls all the elements together..
