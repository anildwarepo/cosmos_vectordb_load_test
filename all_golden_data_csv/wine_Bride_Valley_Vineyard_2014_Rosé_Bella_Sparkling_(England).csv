country: England.
description: Restrained notes of tart red berry and pink grapefruit play on the nose of this wine. The palate is taut but has an appetizing touch of wet stone along with fresh, fruity notes and a mellow but bright autolytic core that creates a harmonious impression. Tiny bubbles fizz away beatifically, sure in the knowledge that they go straight to your heart. This is quietly convincing, just being its very elegant self..
