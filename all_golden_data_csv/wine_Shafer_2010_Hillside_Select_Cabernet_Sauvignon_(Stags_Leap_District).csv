country: US.
description: The producer's annual, highly anticipated 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, this comes from the wilds of the appellation's rocky hillsides. This is a burly, distinctive and sizable wine, ripe yet refined, having been given three years in barrel and another in bottle before release. Chocolaty tobacco combines with pencil shavings and dense blackberry before finishing in an explosion of black pepper. Gorgeous, it will get even more interesting over time, through 2025..
