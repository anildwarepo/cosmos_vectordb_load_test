country: US.
description: Estate grown, this is the only white from the Wayfarer Vineyard out on the Fort Ross-Seaview coast, and it's stunning. Culled from several distinct blocks planted to a handful of clones, including Mt. Eden and Old Wente, the aromas are pretty in orange blossom and peach, the body expansive and flinty. Succulent, the wine offers a lot of layered complexity, making it enjoyable now and through 2020â€“2022..
