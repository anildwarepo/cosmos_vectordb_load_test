country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: John Loubser. A blend of 62% Chardonnay and 38% Pinot Noir, this MCC is bright and lively, with forward scents of toasted apple, fresh hay, spiced orange and a touch of honeycomb. The creamy and full-bodied palate is balanced by bright acidity and brisk effervescence, with a final note of toasted brioche that lingers on the close. You can enjoy it's youthful vibrancy now, but it should age well through 2021..
