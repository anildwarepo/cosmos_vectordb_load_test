country: France.
description: This is as serious as Provence rosé can get. It is a limited production wine, selected from the best Grenache (75%) and Syrah (25%) parcels. Structured and impressively dense, its red fruits are concentrated, bone-dry and with a textured character. It is ready to drink although it will become richer from early 2016. The Sumeire family arrived in the Sainte Victoire mountain range in the 13th century..
