.
Instructions:.
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cut and set aside 25 pieces of plastic wrap about 5 inches square..
- For cookies, beat 1/2 cup vegetable shortening, 2 cups milk, 2 cups sugar, the eggs, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract together in a large mixing bowl until smooth and creamy..
- In a separate bowl, whisk 4 cups flour with 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa, baking soda, and salt until thoroughly combined. Beat the flour mixture into the wet ingredients just until smooth..
- Scoop up the batter by teaspoons, and drop onto ungreased baking sheets in small round dollops about 2 inches apart. Recipe should make about 50 cookies. Cookies will rise and expand a lot..
- Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are set in the middle, 8 to 10 minutes. Allow to cool on baking sheets for several minutes before removing to finish cooling on racks..
- To make the filling, place 1 cup milk in a microwave-safe measuring cup, and microwave until hot but not simmering, 1 to 2 minutes..
- Pour heated milk into a large mixing bowl. Add 1 cup room temperature butter, 1 cup vegetable shortening, 2 cups sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, and marshmallow creme. Beat the mixture on high speed until the frosting is fluffy, 5 to 10 minutes. At first the frosting will appear lumpy, but keep beating..
- To fill cookies, choose 2 cookies that are about the same size, and spread about 1 1/2 tablespoons of frosting onto the flat bottom of a cookie. Top with the other cookie, flat-side down, and wrap the filled cookie in a sheet of plastic wrap. Place filled cookie in the freezer. Repeat with remaining cookies and frosting, wrapping each whoopie pie in plastic wrap and freezing..
- To serve, remove whoopie pies from the freezer and allow to thaw until very cold but not frozen, 10 to 15 minutes..
