country: France.
description: Gently perfumed hints of ripe pear almost seem to have a floral dimension. On the palate the mellow, generous and totally ripe pear fruit unfolds fully and gives glimpses of very juicy ripe, dried and baked fruit. All of this richness is countered by lemony freshness. There is an earthy textural element, and more shimmering fruit reminiscent of bottled mirabelle plums. This is generous and just off dry, with a concentrated, convincing and very moreish balanced richness..
