wine_Quinta_do_Perdigão_2011_Alfrocheiro_(Dão),"Unnamed: 0: 81939.
country: Portugal.
description: This is an unusual limited-production wine from Perdigão's highest hottest vineyard. It is not often to find a 100% Alfrocheiro despite being native to the Dão region. The strongly tannic wine, which spent 12 months in wood, is intensely perfumed with hedgerow flowers and mint while full of dark plum-skin flavors. It has power and concentration and is likely to remain very firm into the future. Drink now or take a risk and cellar..
