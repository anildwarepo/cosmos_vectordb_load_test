country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Bruce Jack. A blend of equal parts Shiraz, Malbec and Barbera, this leads with jammy yet fresh aromas of lush raspberry, cherry and plum, all hit with dustings of black pepper and chocolate. Rich berry flavors carry through to the medium-weight palate, framed by fine yet supportive tannins and ample acidity. The crushed velvet texture is complemented by final notes of licorice and toasted peppercorn. Drink nowâ€“2022..
