country: US.
description: A darker shade of yellow in the glass, this bottling from an Alban clone turns out to be a lighter, more delicate take on Roussanne. Touches of saffron, wax and toasted nuts show on the nose, and that light nutty character does extend to the sip. But the palate also offers apricot and lemon rinds against well measured acidity and a compelling minerality that combines white rocks and hot sand flavors..
