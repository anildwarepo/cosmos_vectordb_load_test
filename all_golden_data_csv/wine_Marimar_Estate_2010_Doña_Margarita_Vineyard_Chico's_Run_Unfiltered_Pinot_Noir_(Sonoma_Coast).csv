description: The perfume on this Pinot Noir is so gorgeous, you're tempted to just smell it. It gives off waves of raspberry Newton cookie, fig, orange zest and vanilla bean, and the flavors are even richer. So much power in such a delicately structured wine, it's a real achievement. The garnet color is as translucent as glass, the acidity is perfect and the alcohol gives the wine body and weight without being hot or heavy. As good as it is now, it will also cellar well; drink now–2018..
