country: US.
description: This is the small-production, flagship wine from the Sierra region's best producer of Rh√¥ne-style wines. Lovely, spicy, floral aromas and generous, complex and layered flavors make the wine irresistible, while its strong but velvety texture sets it up for a long life in the cellar for those who can resist. It smells lightly oaky, like a cigar box and cocoa, tastes deep and focused on blackberry, pomegranate and dark chocolate. The mouthfeel is both rich and a bit reserved. Best to drink from 2020 to 2030..
