country: US.
description: It's hard to ripen Bordeaux red varietals in Monterey, but this was a good vintage and Mirassou has some good vineyards. The fruit is scented with blackberries and plums and even deeper notes of chocolate, espresso, and smoked meat. There's also a generous dose of oak. It drinks fine and dry, and captures that magical quality of finesse and elegance despite its size, which is considerable. A plush, opulent wine..
