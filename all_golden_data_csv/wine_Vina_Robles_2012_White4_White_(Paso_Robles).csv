country: US.
description: Paso Robles is achieving fame for its offbeat white blends, and this wine is a perfect example of why. Made from Viognier, Verdelho, Vermentino and Sauvignon Blanc, it's one of the most beautifully drinkable whites on the market today, at a great price. Brisk acidity, a steely minerality and mouthwatering citrus fruit combine with richer, riper notes of nectarine and peach to produce a vibrant wine..
