country: US.
description: A complex, ageworthy wine that combines contradictions but somehow is complete and wholesome. The cool vintage shows up in the form of green olives and sweet green peas, a taste that's unusual for Oakville but one that works well alongside the more traditional black currants and sweet oak. The tannins are pure Oakville, rich, ripe and dramatically layered. Beautiful in every respect, this 100% Cab will reward cellaring. Begin popping the cork in 2018..
