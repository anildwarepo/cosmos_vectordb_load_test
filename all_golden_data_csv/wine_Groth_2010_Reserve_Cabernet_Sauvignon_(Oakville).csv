country: US.
description: If you don't cellar this Cab, you'll miss out on what it has to offer. It is a dry, deeply flavored, superbly structured wine, rich in tannins, with brooding depths of flavors ranging from black currants, cassis and licorice to hints of dried herbs and sweet, toasty cedar wood. The alcohol is on the high side, in the modern Napa style, but the wine wears its heat well. Start drinking it after 2018..
