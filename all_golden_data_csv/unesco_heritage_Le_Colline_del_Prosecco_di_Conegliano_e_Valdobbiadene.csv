short_description: Located in north-eastern Italy, the property includes part of the winegrowing landscape of the Prosecco wine production area. The landscape is characterized by ‘hogback’ hills, <em>ciglioni</em> – small plots of vines on narrow grassy terraces – forests, small villages and farmland. For centuries, this rugged terrain has been shaped and adapted by man. Since the 17th century, the use of <em>ciglioni</em> has created a particular chequerboard landscape consisting of rows of vines parallel and vertical to the slopes. In the 19th century, the <em>bellussera</em> technique of training the vines contributed to the aesthetic characteristics of the landscape..
