The respondent Commissioner lodge with the Court and with the taxpayer applicants draft declarations and/or orders giving effect to the reasons for judgment within fourteen days, including orders as to costs. 90 Thereafter I was referred to the ratio decidendi of the Full Federal Court in Saffron v Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 30 FCR 578, and what was said in the joint judgment of Hill and Lander JJ in the Full Federal Court in the Spassked proceedings, those decisions being said by the taxpayer applicants to indicate that '... a different outcome in respect of a different year is not to be regarded as a matter which would bring the administration of justice into disrepute'. It is unnecessary to refer in detail to the ratio in Saffron, which is somewhat removed from the issues presently arising. The issue there arising related to whether evidence of the conviction of a taxpayer of conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth carried the consequence that the convicted taxpayer was estopped from challenging the Commissioner's decisions on objections to that person's income tax assessments. No such principle was acknowledged by the Full Federal Court, it being held in effect that a conviction is conclusive evidence merely of that which it established, being the fact of conviction for the offence, but not of the facts lying behind the conviction. Consequently the orders of the Full Court including the following: 'The applicant may conduct his case in the income tax appeal presently before this Court for the purpose of enabling the court to determine the true liability of the applicant to income tax in each of the relevant years of income involved in the appeal; and for this purpose the applicant may present a case denying that he and James McCartney Anderson agreed that not all the cash received from the conduct of businesses in which they were involved, including the nightclub businesses known as the Venus Room and the Carousel, would be declared for income tax purposes. But the applicant shall not conduct his case for the purpose of challenging the propriety of his conviction for the criminal offence of conspiring with Mr Anderson to defraud the Commissioner or the fairness of the trial.' 91 I think that there is something to be said for the view that in the present context to the present proceedings, for the taxpayer applicants to be permitted to contest the issues the subject of the critical findings of the primary judge and the members of the Full Court, to which I have earlier referred as to Spassked's circumstances relevantly from 1988 to 1994, would bring the administration of justice into dispute, given the nature and extent of those findings which the Commissioner would presently invoke as the basis for the Commissioner's contention as to abuse of process, as well as for issue estoppel and Anshun estoppel. The particular context involved in Saffron was of course distant to that involved in the earlier concluded Spassked proceedings and presently involved, but nevertheless not to the extent of entirely excluding a useful illustration as to the operation of the doctrine of abuse of process here invoked by the Commissioner. 112 The taxpayer applicants contended of course for the operation of a per se entitlement to litigate, discretely or cumulatively, in relation to each of the 1991, 1993 and 1994, and apparently also the 1996, fiscal year revenue objections, and the consequential disputes the subject of disallowed objections, in line with those English decisions of high authority. Bearing in mind those distinguishing jurisdictional features, and as the Commissioner moreover rightly observed, if the taxpayer applicants were to be permitted to raise for redetermination each and all of the same substantive issues, or virtually so, that were raised, considered and determined in the earlier Spassked proceedings, albeit that the latter proceedings were geared and related to a different fiscal year (ie 1992), being issues principally as to the purpose of relevant borrowings, and as to the use or otherwise of borrowed funds in activities carried on for the purpose, or otherwise in the course of gaining or producing assessable income, and if the taxpayer applicants were to be successful in any such further proceedings against the Commissioner, there would be on record, as I have already mentioned, what would be inconsistent or substantially inconsistent reasons for judgment of the Federal Court. All that would constitute situations well removed, conceptually as well as contextually, from that involved for instance in Saffron . Moreover there was reversed by the Privy Council's decision in Broken Hill what had been an earlier decision of a Full Bench (by majority) of the High Court of Australia, and there was inconsistency between that decision of the Privy Council and the almost contemporaneous Privy Council decision in Hoysted , involving an appeal which also emanated from Australia . Moreover as has been further mentioned, Hoysted was applied by the Full Court in Chamberlain (though the principal judgment of the High Court in Chamberlain cited Caffoor though briefly and not in any controversial context), and Caffoor and Hope did not involve appeals from Australia. Furthermore Dixon J (as he then was) in Blair v Curran cited Hoysted , not irrelevantly in terms of the scope of principle here the subject of scrutiny. The High Court in Falk , without expressing any preference, pointed to the dilemma in reconciling Broken Hill with Hoysted. More directly of assistance to the Commissioner's case moreover was the favourable approach taken to Hoysted adopted by those three members of the High Court in Queensland Trustees who made reference to Hoysted. In all those circumstances, the emphatic approach adopted by the taxpayer applicants in the present proceedings as to the operation authoritatively of the Privy Council decisions in Broken Hill , Caffoor and Hope might be thought to have at best debateable viability, particularly if account be also taken of the nature and extent of the jurisdiction and functions exercised by the tribunals etc from where at least the litigation in Caffoor and Hope originated..
