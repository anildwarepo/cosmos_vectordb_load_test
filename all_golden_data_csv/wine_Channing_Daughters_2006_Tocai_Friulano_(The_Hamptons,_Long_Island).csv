country: US.
description: This is the only Long Island version of this white grape variety from northeastern Italy, but perhaps there should be more. Fermented in a mix of stainless steel and used wood, there's a touch of custardy richness and some dried-spice notes, but the emphasis is on clean, crisp melon, pineapple and citrus fruit. It's medium-bodied, with an appealing focus to the lingering finish that would make it an attractive pairing to many of the region's seafoods..
