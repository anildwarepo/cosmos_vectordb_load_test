Description: LOST, the television series, takes place on a remote South Pacific island, where a plane crash has left 48 survivors stranded. This novel focuses on Bernard, a college student with a closely-guarded secret - he-s not really a rich kid but a poor poseur who has been faking it to impress his wealthy girlfriend. Through his encounters with Jack and other major characters as they battle the island wilderness, Bernard starts to realize he-s not alone in keeping up a false front. But as his secret identity is exposed, Bernard finds an inner strength and the courage to face what he may lose - and gain -- by being stranded.
