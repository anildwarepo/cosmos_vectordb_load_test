country: US.
description: Originally made between the 1930s and early 1960s, Cask was given new life by Francis Ford Coppola in the mid-1990s. This vintage is on the money in terms of style, going for a timeless, elegantly lean wine with dense tannins and plenty of vibrancy. Cranberry, black tea and a tease of green olive mark the entry, before denser elements of coffee and tobacco feature on the finish. Cellar through 2021..
