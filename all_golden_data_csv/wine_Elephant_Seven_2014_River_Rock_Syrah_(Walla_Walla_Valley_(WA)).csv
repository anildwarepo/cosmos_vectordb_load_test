country: US.
description: Coming from a vineyard down in The Rocks District and at a quite low alcohol level for the state, especially considering the warmth of the vintage, this wine brings aromas of cranberry compote, herb, thistle and mineral. The flavors are light and elegant, almost faint at times, but showing a pleasing purity and a finish that lingers. It piques the interest, with cranberry juice notes lingering on the finish..
