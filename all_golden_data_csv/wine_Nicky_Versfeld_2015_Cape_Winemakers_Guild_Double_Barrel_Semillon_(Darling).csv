country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Nicky Versfeld. The bouquet of this wine is currently a bit closed and restrained, with only delicate notes of fresh herbs, fig leaf, peach and sweet citrus to be discovered upon deep nosing. The palate is rich, full and smoothly textured, as oaky tones of sweet spice and honeyed nuts overwhelm the delicate fruit profile. A bit more integration and harmony should come with some time; try after 2017..
