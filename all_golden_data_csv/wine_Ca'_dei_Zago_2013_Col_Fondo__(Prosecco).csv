country: Italy.
description: Here's a Prosecco with real personality. Left to finish fermentation in the bottle on its lees and made without any added dosage, it displays a slightly cloudy appearance from fine sediment deposited at the bottom, which gives it another dimension. Pure flavors include tart green apple, lime, white peach and kiwi, with a hint of lemon pastry. It's balanced in mouthwatering acidity and finishes bone-dry..
