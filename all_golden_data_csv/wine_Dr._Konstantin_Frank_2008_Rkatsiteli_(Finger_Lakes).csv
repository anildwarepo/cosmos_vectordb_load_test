country: US.
description: There's something wonderfully intriguing about Dr. Konstantin Frank's Rkatsiteli, an ancient Georgian grape variety that pays homage to the original Dr. Frank's European roots. Fragrant with fresh apples, sweet figs and a subdued paraffin note, it's a light profile wine, but with a uniquely luscious mouthfeel. Well balanced with a clean minerality and bright, sour tangerine acidity, there's a touch of salinity in the finish that makes it a fabulous companion to seafood..
