wine_Rubicon_Estate_2005_Rubicon_Red_(Rutherford),"Unnamed: 0: 14347.
country: US.
description: Made from 98% Cabernet Sauvignon, with no Merlot or Cabernet Franc for the first time, the '05 Rubicon tastes bigger and more impenetrable than any previous vintage. It's thick and heavy at this time, with furry tannins and undeniably ripe flavors of blackberries, black currants, cherries, violets, chocolate and cedar, and a tang of melted minerals. Desperately needs time in the cellar. Nowhere near ready for at least four years, and that may be conservative. Tasted three times, and better each time, a seriously good sign, and potentially a perfect wine..
