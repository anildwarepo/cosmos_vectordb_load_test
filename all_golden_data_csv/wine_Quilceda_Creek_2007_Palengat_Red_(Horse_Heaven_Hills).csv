wine_Quilceda_Creek_2007_Palengat_Red_(Horse_Heaven_Hills),"Unnamed: 0: 101605.
country: US.
description: Quilceda's Palengat is now a proprietary blend, not a strict Cabernet as before. You can smell the violets amidst nicely layered aromatics, built upon layers of black fruits, cassis and dark, smoky elements. Smoke, earth, coffee, a hint of iron and rock continue into the midpalate, which loses a little density as it moves through the finish. That may be a reflection of the young-ish (7 to 10 year old) vines..
