country: US.
description: The vineyard produces everything from Pinot Noir and Sauvignon Blanc to Chardonnay and Syrah for the winery, with generally good results. This Pinot shows the exotic notes of wildland herbs and pine that so often show up in Fort Ross-Seaview Pinots. But it's also rich in cherries, and the acidity is just about perfect. With a delicacy of mouthfeel, it's a fine example of coastal Pinot Noir, but it needs time. Give it until 2020..
