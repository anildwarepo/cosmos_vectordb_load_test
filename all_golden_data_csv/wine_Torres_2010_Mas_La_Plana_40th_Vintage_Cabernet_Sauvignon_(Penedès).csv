country: Spain.
description: Spain's preeminent varietal Cabernet is excellent in its 40th rendition. This single-vineyard wine opens with dark, brooding aromas of rooty spice, licorice, tar, herbs, cassis and prune. In the mouth, this is wiry and tight at the core, but friendly around the edges. Flavors of currant, toast, vanilla, pepper and barbecue sauce finish with ripping acidity but also cuddly, creamy weight. Drink from 2017 through 2030..
