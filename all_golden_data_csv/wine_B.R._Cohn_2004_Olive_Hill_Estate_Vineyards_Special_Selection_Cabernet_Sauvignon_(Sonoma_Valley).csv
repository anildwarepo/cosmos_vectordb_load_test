description: This is a limited production 100% Cab from the winery's estate vineyard. It's much more tannic than Cohn's extraordinarily fine '04 Estate, which was released a year ago. Even at the age of five-plus, it stings with sandpapery astringency. Should easily negotiate the years, with its massive core of blackberries, black currants, olives and 100% new oak. Hold until after 2010, and should develop for many years beyond..
