.
Description: Onion flavored ground beef with broth is served on hamburger buns in this Iowa classic sandwich. I came up with my own version of Iowa MaidRites which also are called 'loose meat' sandwiches. Very versatile, leftover beef can be used for spaghetti or taco filling, or it can be frozen for later use..
.
Ingredients:.
- 4 pounds ground beef.
- 1 (1 ounce) envelope dry onion soup mix.
- 1.5 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed French onion soup.
- 16 hamburger buns, split.
.
Instructions:.
- Crumble the ground beef into a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until evenly browned, crumbling even more as it cooks. Drain off the grease. Stir in the onion soup mix and French onion soup. Cover, and simmer over low heat for about 2 hours, or you may transfer to a slow cooker for this part..
- To serve, spoon onto hamburger buns like a sloppy Joe..
