wine_Domaine_Coustarret_2012_Le_Barou__(Jurançon),"Unnamed: 0: 9803.
country: France.
description: With light touches of wood aging, this delicate, honeyed wine has all the poise and style of Jurançon, in the foothills of the Pyrénées mountains. Lightly stepping between freshness and rich, ripe, sweet fruitiness, the wine is full of apricot, sweet apple and lime acidity. It is delicious, but it would be a shame for the taste Sébastien and Isabelle Bordenave-Coustarret created not to age it, so drink from 2019..
