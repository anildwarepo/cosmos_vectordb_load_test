country: US.
description: This Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend contains smaller amounts of Cabernet Franc and Merlot. The grapes come from all over the valley, mountains as well as flatlands, making it a testament to the art of blending. The warmer, riper areas bring lush chocolate and blackberry jam flavors, while the cooler areas contribute structural elements of firm tannins and acidity. The result is delicious and compelling. Drink over the next four years..
