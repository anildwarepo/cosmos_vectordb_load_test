wine_Adelsheim_2013_Caitlin's_Reserve_Chardonnay_(Willamette_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 116610.
country: US.
description: This new vintage of Caitlin's Reserve was barrel-fermented in 25% new French oak. It went through regular lees stirring and a generally traditional Burgundian élévage. Trim and compact, it remains up to the taster to forecast how well this will age, and how much complexity is locked within it. Based upon the wine's track record, there's every reason to put away a few bottles to drink in the mid-2020s..
