Description: On the face of it, Rebecca Bloomwood has it all. Confident, single and happily living in desres Fulham, she's a financial journalist who spends her days writing articles advising other people on the importance of budgeting and prudent investment. Her private life is a different story though; Rebecca manages her own finaces in a way that would make most of her reader's hair curl. For Rebecca is a woman on a mission - she just can't stop spending (Publisher).
