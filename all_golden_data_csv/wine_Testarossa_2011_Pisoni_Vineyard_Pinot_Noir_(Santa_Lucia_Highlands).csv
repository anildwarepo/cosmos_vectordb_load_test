country: US.
description: This single-vineyard wine feels light and silky in the mouth, like the passing of a cloud. Yet incredibly ripe cherry, raspberry, strawberry and cola flavors give it weight and importance, making it sweetly delicious. Brilliant acidity provides balance, suggesting pairing it with barbecued steak. But there's also as guarantee foraging as you can get in a California Pinot Noir. Should still be gathering steam in 2023..
