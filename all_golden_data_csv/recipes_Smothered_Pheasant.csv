Description: This simple pheasant recipe makes its own gravy that is delicious on mashed potatoes..
.
Ingredients:.
- 6 skinless, boneless pheasant breast halves.
- salt and black pepper to taste.
- 0.5 cup all-purpose flour.

Shake off excess flour and set aside. Melt the butter in an ovenproof Dutch oven or deep skillet over medium heat.
