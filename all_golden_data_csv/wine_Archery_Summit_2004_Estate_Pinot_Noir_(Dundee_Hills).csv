country: US.
description: This is from the vineyard that surrounds the winery, and the bottling receives both Estate and Dundee Hills designations—best of the best. It's a pungent, pleasant wine upon entry, with rather pale strawberry fruit. It quickly moves through the midpalate and turns lean, with tomato leaf and green tea astringency. There is a slight impression of alcoholic heat. Though accessible and interesting, it somehow falls short of what it could/should be, given its provenance and price..
