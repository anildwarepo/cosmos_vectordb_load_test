country: Australia.
description: Although there is only 5% Cab Franc in the blend, it appears to have quite an impact on this wine's aromas, which are intriguingly perfumed and contain some minty, leafy notes. Flavors also hint at mint with some subtle cedary notes, although the primary fruit is blueberry. Like the 2005 Georgia's Paddock, it's full-bodied and creamy-textured, although this wine adds a slightly more tannic edge to the finish. Drink 2010â€“2020..
