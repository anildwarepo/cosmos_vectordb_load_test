country: US.
description: Block One is the original (1972) planting at Champoux, and it has anchored many of Washington's finest wines over the past 20 years. Few if any better are than this, a huge wine with massive flavors of dense black fruits, from berries to cherries to cassis. It's seen plenty of new oak, giving it a cedar-soaked scent, but the sheer power of the wine promises a long and expressive development over the coming decades..
