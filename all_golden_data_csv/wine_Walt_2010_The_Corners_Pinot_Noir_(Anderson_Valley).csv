country: US.
description: This is a big Pinot Noir, with an explosive intensity of cherries and raspberries that is ripe and pure. Oak, of course, is there too, in the form of buttered, smoky toast. However, the wine isn't a mere fruit bomb. It has interesting nuances of earthy things, like mushrooms, nettles and Proven√ßal herbs. The silky texture is an exquisite balance of acids and tannins. This new brand from Hall winery is made by their talented winemaker, Steve Leveque, and it immediately enters the California pantheon of excellent Pinot Noirs..
