country: France.
description: Always a dense, dark and concentrated selection, La Forge is a wine that is immediately attractive but would be best after a few years of cellaring. Notes of dark berry preserves, muddled boysenberry, raspberry sauce, cocoa, leather and truffle abound on the nose and palate. The mouthfeel is plush and creamy, with medium tannins and a texture like crushed velvet. The finish is long and spicy, offering notes of black pepper and charred oak spice..
