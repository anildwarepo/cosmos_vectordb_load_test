country: Italy.
description: Ripe black-skinned fruit, bell pepper, dried herb, French oak and balsamic aromas lead the nose on this 100% Merlot. The ripe concentrated palate offers dried blackberry, raw cranberry, espresso, vanilla and a confectionery note alongside firm, grainy tannins that leave an astringent mouth-drying finish. Give the tannins another year or two to soften, then drink up to enjoy the remaining freshness and fruit..
