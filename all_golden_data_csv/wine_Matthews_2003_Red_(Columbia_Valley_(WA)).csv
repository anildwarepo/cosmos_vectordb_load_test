wine_Matthews_2003_Red_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 105182.
country: US.
description: This has rich tannins, dense fruit and overall deep flavors. This is a dark wine, just this side of brooding, with ripe blueberry and cherry fruit, softly chalky tannins, whiffs of smoke and splashes of pepper. The dark fruit flavors are bold and seamless, melded with smoke and chocolate, dotted with ground espresso, and finished with a nice lift. This probably needs another five years to really show all of its complexity..
