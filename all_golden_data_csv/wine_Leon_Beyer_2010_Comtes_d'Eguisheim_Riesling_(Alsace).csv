country: France.
description: Both dried and baked apple appear enticingly on the nose. A further sniff reveals the appetizing tartness of Cox Orange Pippin apples. The palate is concentrated and gathered around a rich core of fruit: ripe citrus, zesty lemon rind, baked apples. This is dry, yet with every sip you want to dive deeper into that heart of fruit. It is the lemon that forms the fresh but absolutely dry finish. The flavors clearly are evolving: join the journey now or over the coming years. Drink now through 2030..
