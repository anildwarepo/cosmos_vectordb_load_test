wine_Chanin_2013_Los_Alamos_Vineyard_Pinot_Noir_(Santa_Barbara_County),"Unnamed: 0: 34643.
country: US.
description: A lighter shade of ruby red in the glass, this wine by young vintner Gavin Chanin—whose original art adorns the label—shows delicate aromas of whole cranberries, shaved fennel and dried tobacco. Pomegranate and cranberry fruits arise on the palate, but pine sap flavors are more prominent, along with licorice and eucalyptus. A strong tannic backbone for such a light wine indicates it will drink amazingly from 2018–2030..
