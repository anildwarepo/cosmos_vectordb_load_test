country: England.
description: Freshly cut peel of tart but ripe red apple entices on the nose. The palate embraces all this with the subtle, creamy richness of autolysis: Think shortcake and soft sponge. A luminous core of fresh, brisk acidity brightens everything, lifting up flavors of red apple, strawberry and tart red currant on the palate. This harmonious rosé leaves a lasting impression and is appetizing with its lightning streak of freshness..
