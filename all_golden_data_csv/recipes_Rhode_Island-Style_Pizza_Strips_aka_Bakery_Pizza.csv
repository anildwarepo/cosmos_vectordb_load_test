Description: Simple pizza-flavored appetizers, inspired by the ones you can get at Italian bakeries and markets in Rhode Island, have optional pepperoni. It's best made with bulk pizza dough rather than a premade refrigerated crust..
.
Ingredients:.
- 2 pounds prepared pizza dough.
- 1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes.
- 0.5 cup minced pepperoni.
- 0.25 cup olive oil.
- 3 tablespoons grated Romano cheese.
- 3 tablespoons white sugar.
- 1 teaspoon salt.
- 0.75 teaspoon minced garlic.
- 0.75 teaspoon dried oregano.
- 0.5 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper.
- 0.25 cup olive oil, divided.
.
Instructions:.
- Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets or line with parchment paper..
- Divide dough in half and roll or press each half out onto each prepared baking sheet into rectangles..
- Mix crushed tomatoes, pepperoni, 1/4 cup olive oil, Romano cheese, sugar, salt, garlic, oregano, and black pepper in a bowl, stirring to dissolve sugar and salt. Spread half the sauce evenly over each crust, spreading it all the way to the edges. Drizzle top of each pizza with 2 tablespoons olive oil..
- Bake in the preheated oven until the sauce looks dry at the edges, still moist in the middle, and crusts are crisp on the bottom, 15 to 20 minutes..
- Let cool to room temperature on racks and cut each pizza into 8 strips about 9 inches long and 3 inches wide..
