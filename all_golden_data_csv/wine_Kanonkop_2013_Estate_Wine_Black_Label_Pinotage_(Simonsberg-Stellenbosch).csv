country: South Africa.
description: What a bold and powerful selection this is. It opens with intense aromas of blackberry, black plum and boysenberry that are hit with spicy notes of black pepper, cured meat, leather and Thin Mint. The plush and concentrated palate is like crushed velvet in texture, with gripping yet balanced tannins to support the rich, dense black-fruit flavors. The finish transitions from black cherry and boysenberry fruit to menthol, followed by lingering cocoa nib and charred oak tones. Drink 2019â€“2024..
