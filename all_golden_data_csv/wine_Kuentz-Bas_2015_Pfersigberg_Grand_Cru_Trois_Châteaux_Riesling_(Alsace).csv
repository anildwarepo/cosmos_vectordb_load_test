country: France.
description: A touch of yeast still clings to the beautifully fresh apple nose of this wine while the palate still tingles with some residual carbon dioxide. This is rather young but the fruit is very pure in crisp green-apple notes and fresh, tangy lemon. The palate is absolutely dry and very taut and fresh. Some yeasty notes also swing along on the palate. This certainly needs bottle age but promises to become a lemon-scented, fresh and linear marvel. It certainly has bags of tension and freshness. The finish is bright, refreshing and utterly clean..
