Application Description: Designed to accompany visitors in their discovery of the Leonardo Museum at Vinci, the oldest collection dedicated entirely to Leonardo da Vinci’s machines and inventions, this app is a genuine guide to the collection, which you’ll find both responsive and complete. By selecting the most suitable type of visit depending on the time you have available, or choosing the entertaining visit dedicated to families with children, you can immerse yourself into the atmosphere of the Renaissance and explore Leonardo’s studies and intuitions through the models that were constructed based on his countless manuscripts. The cranes and winches conceived by Brunelleschi, which Leonardo had the opportunity to see and draw at the construction site for the Florence Cathedral dome; the innovative and little-known machines for automating processes involved in textile manufacturing, to which he dedicated much time and effort; the weapons and bridges he designed to impress warlords; the futuristic studies on flight and water aimed at harnessing natural elements in service of mankind; and, finally, the experiments in optics and the anatomical drawings that testify to the intense research work behind Leonardo’s extraordinary pictorial legacy. In addition to this, the app invites you to discover the places linked with Leonardo in his hometown, especially the birth house at Anchiano, where you can get to know the pictorial works of the Master and, lastly, experience a very special meeting with the Genius, retracing, through his words, the profound ties he had with his native land.Read moreCollapse.
