country: Austria.
description: Smoke and vanilla spice hover above appetizing notions of tart red-berry fruit. The body is light and spicy and has a touch of fragrant conifer and an abundance of lovely unforced cranberry and red cherry. There is a pervasive freshness and elegance to this wine, which lifts it well above the ordinary. Pinot lovers will rejoice in the spice and light-footedness, but there is a serious beautiful core of fruit and a lasting peppery finish..
