country: US.
description: Pretty in floral aromatics of orange blossom and lemon verbena, this balanced, lush, delicious wine comes from a relatively new, small producer. Grapes were sourced from the Charles Ranch, which is planted to Wente Chardonnay. Apple and citrus intermingle in nice balance, as do minerality and creaminess on the texture. Though the wine spent over a year in French oak, 40% of it new, the oak is unobtrusive, detectable mostly on the finish..
