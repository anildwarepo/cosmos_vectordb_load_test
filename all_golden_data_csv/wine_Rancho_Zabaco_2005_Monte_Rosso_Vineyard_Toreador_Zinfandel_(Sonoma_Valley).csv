country: US.
description: The Toreador bottling represents the best Zin winemaker Eric Cinnamon can make from the vineyard. So far, it's been a complex, ageworthy wine, and the '05 continues that tradition. Despite high alcohol, the wine is balanced, with firm tannins framing flavors of dried cherries and blackberries, pomegranates, red currants, leather, dark chocolate, briary nettles and smoke. It will happily take a decade of bottle age..
