country: US.
description: DuBrul is perhaps the single most sought-after vineyard in the entire Yakima Valley, and at this price this Tamarack selection is an absolute steal. Pomegranate, blueberry, black cherry and cassis notes lead into a full-flavored wine that remains concise and perfectly defined. The blend is 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Franc. This is concentrated, with earthy depths suggesting Dr. Pepper, espresso and dark chocolate..
