wine_Barons_2011_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 6674.
country: US.
description: Founded by a well-heeled group of wine afficionadoes, Barons has seen a change of ownership and a change in winemaking direction. For the first time, French oak has begun to supplant American oak as the barrels of choice. The wine is aromatic, detailed and inviting, with the lower alcohol prevalent in 2011. A rich mix of berry and cassis dives deeply into the palate, with dark chocolate highlights. The tannins are silky and polished, and the wine seems a sure bet to cellar well until the mid-2020's..
