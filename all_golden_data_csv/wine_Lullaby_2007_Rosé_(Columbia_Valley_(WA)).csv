wine_Lullaby_2007_Rosé_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 99398.
country: US.
description: Bottled in a lovely 500 ml bottle, with a label of cut paper with butterflies, this was barrel fermented in neutral oak. It's a beautiful color, a coppery salmon, much like rosé de Provence (where winemaker Virginie Bourgue is from). It's dry and fruity, but more complex than most newly released rosés, with light berry fruits, a lovely texture, and a finish that suggests malted milk chocolate candy..
