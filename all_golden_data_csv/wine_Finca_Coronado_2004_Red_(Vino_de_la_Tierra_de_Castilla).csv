country: Spain.
description: Fans of Miguel Angel de Gregorio's Finca Allende wines from Rioja will want to snap up this excellent, lush-styled blend of Graciano, Merlot and Petit Verdot from La Mancha. This wine almost proves that talent is as important as terroir, because no other La Mancha wine features this grape blend, these rich and pure medicinal flavors, and a smooth-handed sense of balance that calls for drinking now through 2013..
