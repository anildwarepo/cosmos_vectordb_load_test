country: France.
description: Intense lemon and tangerine notes create a most inviting nose. The palate continues in full tangy mode: the aromatic zest of tangerine and ripe Amalfi lemon create a concentrated, uplifting and even cooling freshness. The body is slender but totally concentrated with a dynamic linear structure. Over time, riper notes of honeyed stone fruit appear despite the very dry style, but the chief charms are a marvel of citrus diversity. Drink now through 2035..
