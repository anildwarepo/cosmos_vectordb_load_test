country: Italy.
description: The Sagrantino grape from Umbria makes a uniquely distinguished wine and Goretti's Le Mura Saracene is one of the best examples of this beautiful variety available in the U.S. The wine opens with a bright, saturated color and delivers gorgeous notes of spice, from Indian curry to nutmeg and clove, for deep penetration and personality. Red fruit at the core is left intact, but this is also a very modern rendition with layers of vanilla and roasted nut derived from long oak aging..
