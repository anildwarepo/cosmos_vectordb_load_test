Description: The young men of Kingdome 19 all have at least one prominent talent...and it is wonderfully set into scene in these exceedingly aesthetic photos. Powerful and archaic, these wonderful photos, all hand-finished, bring viewers to a place between yesterday and tomorrow. Viewers can see young men in classic poses who radiate power, vulnerability and an intense melancholy..
