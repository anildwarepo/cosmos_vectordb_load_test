wine_Keating_2012_Encomium_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(North_Coast),"Unnamed: 0: 56682.
country: US.
description: The color is about as deep as wine gets, virtually black except for a thin red-purple rim. The aromas resemble black cherries, even black olives and the flavors are as rich as blackberry jam, but without the sweetness. So this is a bold, full-bodied wine with lots of well-integrated tannins that make it astringent to drink at this young age. It will be best after 2020, when it will have softened and gained more diverse flavors..
