country: US.
description: This is definitely one of Washington's best Sangioveses, capturing the astringency and natural acidity of the grape, but filling in the mid-palate with chewy fruit flavors of berry and spicy cranberry. The light herbal characteristics of the vineyard come through, adding details of leaf and herb. Since this is a 2004, it is already showing some development in the bottle and is drinking very well right now..
