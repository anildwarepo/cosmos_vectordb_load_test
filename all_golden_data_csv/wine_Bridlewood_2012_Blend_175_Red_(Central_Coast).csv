wine_Bridlewood_2012_Blend_175_Red_(Central_Coast),"Unnamed: 0: 74607.
country: US.
description: This savory blend of Syrah, Grenache, Petite Sirah and Viognier (developed, Bridlewood claims, after tasting through the winery's lots 175 times) delivers black pepper, vanilla, stewed fig and roasted pork to the nose. It then clings to flavors like sage and sautéed plum that are more often found in cool-climate Syrah. The tannins are slightly rough, so this may be best in 2015, but it's drinking well now..
