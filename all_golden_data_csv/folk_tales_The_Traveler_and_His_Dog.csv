title: The Traveler and His Dog.
text: A Traveller was about to start on a journey, and said to his Dog, who was stretching himself by the door, “Come, what are you yawning for? Hurry up and get ready: I mean you to go with me.” But the Dog merely wagged his tail and said quietly, “I’m ready, master: it’s you I’m waiting for.”.
