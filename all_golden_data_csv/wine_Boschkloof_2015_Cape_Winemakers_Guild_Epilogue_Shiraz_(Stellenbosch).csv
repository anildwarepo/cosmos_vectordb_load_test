country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Jacques Borman. There's a ton of herbal, earthy tea-like tones to the nose of this wine, supported by notes of black plum, cherry and currant. The palate is smooth upon entry, with satiny tannins and plush, ripe fruit flavors that finish rich and spicy. It's delicious and decadent, though the complexity reigns on the nose as opposed to the palate. It's accessible now, but should hold well through 2022..
