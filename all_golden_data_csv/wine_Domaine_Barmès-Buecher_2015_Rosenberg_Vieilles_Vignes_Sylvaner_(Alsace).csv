description: A lovely mix of aromas appears on the nose: a touch of sandalwood amidst fresh greenery—something at once sonorous and very fresh. The gentle and mostly subtle sandalwood notes continue across the palate, with a touch of mace, alongside something tenderly green, like aloe vera and chervil. This is a most unusual and most intriguing wine. If you were wondering about Sylvaner, here's one to mesmerize you..
