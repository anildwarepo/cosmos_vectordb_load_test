wine_Viader_2009_Red_(Napa_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 53179.
country: US.
description: Made from 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Cabernet Franc, it has every hallmark of a young Napa Valley Bordeaux blend. It's dry, smooth and complex in tannins, with balancing acidity and an incredible array of flavors, including blackberry, black currant, cherry, chocolate, dried herb, smoky oak and spice. It has that important but hard-to-define quality of sophistication. It's delicious now, and it should develop in the bottle for at least 10 years..
