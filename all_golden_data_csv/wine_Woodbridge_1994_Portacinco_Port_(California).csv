wine_Woodbridge_1994_Portacinco_Port_(California),"Unnamed: 0: 67368.
country: US.
description: A blend of five traditional Port varieties, this is a sweet (10% residual sugar), very rich wine of substance and harmony. It has massive flavors of berries with sweet overlays of caramel, chocolate and mint, and the sugars are nicely balanced by crisp acidity, although the texture is soft and velvety. This tasty wine achieves the complexity and provides the satisfaction of a good late bottled vintage Port. Drink it now with rich chocolate-based desserts..
