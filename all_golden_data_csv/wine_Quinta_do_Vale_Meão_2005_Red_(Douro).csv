country: Portugal.
description: The quinta of Vale Meão, Dona Antonia Ferreira's last creation in the 19th century is one of the Douro's great vineyards. This is a wine that needs many years of aging, its tannins dominating what is also intense black, dense fruit. It is certainly powerful, but not out of balance, with an herbal element and precise acidity acting as a check, while the fruits gain in opulence in the mouth. Age for 10 years..
