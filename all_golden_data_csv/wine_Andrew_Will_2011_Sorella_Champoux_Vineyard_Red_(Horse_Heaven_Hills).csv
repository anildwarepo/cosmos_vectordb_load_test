description: In a blind tasting, it's hard to imagine many people would identify this wine as from Washington, due to the coolness of the vintage and the style. It's almost impenetrable when first opened, with brooding notes of graphite, exotic spice, herbs, toast and dark fruit. The acids are mouthwatering, the tannins firm and tightly wound, and they need significant time to uncoil. But when they do, the wine glorious. Give it at least until 2019 in the cellar or a 24+ hour decant. One of the highlights of the vintage..
