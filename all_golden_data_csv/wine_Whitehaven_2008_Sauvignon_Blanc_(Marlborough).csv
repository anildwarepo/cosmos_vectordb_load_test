country: New Zealand.
description: Winemaker Simon Waghorn has been able to maintain this brand's quality even as production has ramped up to 100,000 cases, a remarkable feat. The 2008 features ripe, tropical fruit aromas of guava and pineapple that morph easily into flavors of nectarine and fig; expect some herbal notes to emerge by the time it reaches consumers. It's plump in the mouth, yet finishes with a mouthwatering, clean, crisp finish..
