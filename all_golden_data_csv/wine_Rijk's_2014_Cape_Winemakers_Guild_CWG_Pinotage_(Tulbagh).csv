country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Pierre Wahl. This is a ripe and decadent expression of Pinotage, which is not uncommon from Rijk's. It leads with seductive notes of black forest cake, baked brown sugar and brambly berries, all of which continue on to the smooth, silky palate. The medium-length finish boasts notes of raspberry sauce and spied chocolate-berry compote, with just enough acidity to keep it from feeling overly done or heavy. Drink nowâ€“2020..
