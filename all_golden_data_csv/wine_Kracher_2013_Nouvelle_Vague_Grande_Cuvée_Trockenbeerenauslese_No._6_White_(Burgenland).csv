country: Austria.
description: Candied lemon, beeswax and honey are wrapped in the sumptuous embrace of vanilla. Topnotes of passion fruit and nettle appear too, while the palate is conquered by the all-encompassing concentration of this TBA. The precise flavors have a bright, etched citrus frame that shapes and balances the sweetness. Apricot, bergamot, apple and passion fruit all make an appearance. Aromatically, the length goes on and on. It's delicious now, but should hold well through 2040, at least..
