country: US.
description: Buttered berries, bitter rhubarb, bergamot, wet sage and pencil lead comprise another fascinating nose from Bryan Babcok's twist on the Radian Vineyard. The mouthfeel is lush and the flavors quite complicated, with black licorice, cinnamon-laced tea, fennel bulb and underripe blackberries. Boasting a nice tannic structure, this is drinking great right now, but hold off till 2020 for supreme sipping..
