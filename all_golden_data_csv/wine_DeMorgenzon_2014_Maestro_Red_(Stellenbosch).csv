country: South Africa.
description: This Bordeaux-style blend, made from 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Malbec, 16% Merlot and 15% Cabernet Franc, is a complex and layered wine. Pleasant green notes of savory herbs, peppercorn, blackcurrant leaf and brambly berry drive the bouquet, while the medium-weight palate offers flavors of black-fruit skin, char and cigar box all framed by a crushed-velvet texture. It shows good grip, concentration and length, and should drink well through 2021..
