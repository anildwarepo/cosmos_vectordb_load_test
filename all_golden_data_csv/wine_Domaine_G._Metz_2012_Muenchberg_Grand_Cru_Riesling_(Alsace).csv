country: France.
description: The nose is shy but promises development with its heady note of chamomile. The palate reinforces this soothing, herbal and balm-like feeling even more, seemingly dissolving dried chamomile aromas in a sea of fluid, fresh lemon. The palate is absolutely dry and comes with a wonderful lightness of touch. Despite the ripeness of the 2012 vintage this has ease and a spring in its step. This wine is lovely now and will continue to evolve for a long time. Concentration will make sure of that. Drink 2017–2030..
