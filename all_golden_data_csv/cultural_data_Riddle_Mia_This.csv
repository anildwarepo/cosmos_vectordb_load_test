First Page Reviews: It was a little confusing to get started, but lots of fun once we got going. I hope there are more options in the future, as it would not be fun to do the same one again. We got to see some different things because of the app. Takes you through the museum in about an hour, giving you puzzles along the way. A great way to experience the museum! Fun and challenging at the right amount. A good way to discover things you don't about the Mia Didn't work, camera wouldn't open.
