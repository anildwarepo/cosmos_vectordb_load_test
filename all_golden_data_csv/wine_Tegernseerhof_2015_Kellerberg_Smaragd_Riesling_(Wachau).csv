country: Austria.
description: The scent of lemon and orange flesh is contained by lovely zestiness on the nose. The palate is no different and holds ripe juicy stone fruit with exquisitely drawn tangy zestiness. This is concentrated and refreshing, energetic, serious and lively. Its lemony verve characterizes everything from the first whiff to the lasting finish. This is racy and delicious now but will drink well from 2019 through 2035..
