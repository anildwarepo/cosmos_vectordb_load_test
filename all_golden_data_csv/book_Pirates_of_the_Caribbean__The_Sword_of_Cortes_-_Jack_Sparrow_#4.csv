Description: This is it! Jack and his crew have found the Sword of Cortes, but along with it, they’ve also found Cortes himself. And he’s not the kind ruler they thought he’d be. Jack and his crew have defeated a storm king, escaped sirens, defeated the notorious pirate Left Foot Louis, but can they possibly conquer a conquistador with god-like powers?.
