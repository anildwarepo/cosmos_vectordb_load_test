country: France.
description: This takes a few moments to open up on the nose but the gloriously tart but ripe apple notion of Riesling then becomes enticing and irresistible. On the palate the flavors the apple flavor acquires the merest touch of honey while vivid lemon awakes all taste buds. This is intense and incisive but not heavy at all. The palate is dry and poised. The finish is ultraclean and gorgeously lip-smacking. Totally refreshing now but with great potential. Drink 2017–2037..
