country: US.
description: The Red Queen bottling is Evening Land's most limited in terms of production. The grapes are sourced from a block in the estate vineyard at the highest point of the hill, and the wine is aged in 30% new French oak for 14 months. Tasted a few weeks prior to its official release, it was stubbornly unyielding, even after a full 24 hours. Given the pedigree of this estate, and the superb quality of the two other 2010 Pinots, it is reasonable to expect this to come out of its hard shell and earn a much higher score..
