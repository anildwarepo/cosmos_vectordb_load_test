country: US.
description: Onesta is Jillian Johnson's debut of her own wines; she previously made Cinsault-based reds and rosés for the Phoenix Ranch brand. She is not new, however, to the indelible Bechthold Vineyard and its ancient Cinsault grapes, and her passion and expertise with the site shows gorgeously here. Orange-pink in hue, this beauty shares notes of crushed strawberry that are perfectly in balance with its dry, elegant point-of-view. Sip this one all night long, with food or without..
