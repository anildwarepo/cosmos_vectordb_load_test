country: US.
description: Lucky Failla gets to source grapes from this vineyard that most winemakers would trade their left arm for. It's lush, ripe and amazingly generous in raspberries and cherries, yet retains an elegant balance, as well as fine, mouthwatering acidity. Part of the attraction is low alcohol, which lets the stones and earthy complexities of the wine shine through. This is really a brilliant wineâ€”light, delicate and powerful. If you want to age it for eight years or so, you won't be sorry..
