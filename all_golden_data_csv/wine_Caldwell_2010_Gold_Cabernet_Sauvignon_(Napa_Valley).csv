country: US.
description: Big, rich, and dramatic are just a few words that describe this 100% Cabernet grown on the low-yielding estate vineyard in Coombsville. It's lush with black currants, yet bracing in tannins, with a minerality that makes it feel firm and grounded. The barrels are 100% new French oak, lending a savory level of char and vanilla. This is clearly a wine to cellar for a long time. Start enjoying it in 2018, and it is likely to develop bottle complexity throughout the 2020s..
