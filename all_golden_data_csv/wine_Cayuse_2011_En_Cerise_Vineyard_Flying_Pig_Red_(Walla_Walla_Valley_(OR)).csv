country: US.
description: The blend on this Claret-style red is a bit different this year—half Merlot, 40% Cabernet Franc and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon. As with the other 2011 Cayuse reds, this has a noticeable shift to floral, delicate aromas, with the savory/funk present but somewhat muted. The minerality under the ripe raspberry fruit gives it a crunchy feel in the mouth, lightly dusted with fresh herbs. The persistent finish seems to have a steel frame supporting it..
