wine_Netzl_2012_Bärnreiser_Merlot_(Carnuntum),"Unnamed: 0: 77388.
country: Austria.
description: Slight smoke and dark plum, a hint of polished mahogany and the merest touch of leather suggest restrained elegance and complexity. The palate is just medium-bodied but of such subtle balance that the entire wine becomes utterly seductive even though heat is palpable. There are dark, brooding elements of fruit that play above the taut, grippy but fine structure. What a distinguished, beautiful rendition of Merlot..
