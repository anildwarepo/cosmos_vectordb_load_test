description: So enormously delicious, it will be hard to keep from drinking this gorgeous Cabernet right away, and that's just fine. It's composed of the most intensly concentrated flavors of blueberries and blackberries—dense, pure and slightly heady with a liqueur-like alcohol. The tannins are classic Diamond Mountain, firm and minerally, while oak plays the perfect role of the buttered toast and sweetly charred supporting character. Despite its immediate attraction, it's best cellared for 6–8 years, at the very least. Fans of old Cabernets will still be loving it in 2029..
