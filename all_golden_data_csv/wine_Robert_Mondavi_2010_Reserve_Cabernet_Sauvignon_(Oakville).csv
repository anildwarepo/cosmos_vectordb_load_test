country: US.
description: It's easy to use the word “huge” to describe this Cabernet, which contains smaller amounts of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. It immediately takes over the palate with ripe, opulent cherry pie, blackberry tart, cassis liqueur, green olive and oak flavors. The tannins are very strong, the most powerful of Mondavi Cabernets in years. Which leads to the question of ageability. Where's this wine going? On the negative side is high alcohol, which gives it a burn. So drink it over the next 5–6 years..
