country: Austria.
description: Promising aromatics include lifted scents of ripe redcurrant, blood-orange peel and a wild streak of elderberry. These fruit notions carry through on the slinky and smooth palate. Elderberry notes are joined by something more resonant and earthy, reminiscent of truffle and autumn. The structure has light feet but is sure-footed, and the purity of the fruit indicates that it will continue developing. It's a subtle, convincing wine..
