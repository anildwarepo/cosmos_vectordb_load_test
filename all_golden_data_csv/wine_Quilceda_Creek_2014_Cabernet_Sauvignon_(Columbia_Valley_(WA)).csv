wine_Quilceda_Creek_2014_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 67642.
country: US.
description: This wine is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon from Champoux, Palengat and Wallula vineyards, all located with the Horse Heaven Hills appellation. Aromas of incense, dark fruit, licorice and barrel spice rise up from the glass, which also reveals penetrating cherry and anise notes. The flavors are rich and concentrated but far from over the top, with expertly integrated tannins. It brings a very pleasing sense of texture. Just a baby now, but it has the stuffing to go the distance. Best from 2027â€“2033..
