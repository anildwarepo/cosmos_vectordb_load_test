wine_Beresan_2006_Cabernet_Franc_(Walla_Walla_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 92536.
country: US.
description: Needs time to soften up its somewhat aggressive tannins, but it has structure in spades. The aromas are pure varietal—violets and red fruits—and the fruit flavors are young and tart, suggesting watermelon, strawberry and wild raspberry. The tannins are ripe but still a bit sharp, and there is a classic finish of roasted coffee that seems more from the grape than the barrels. The purest possible expression of Cabernet Franc from an exceptional site..
