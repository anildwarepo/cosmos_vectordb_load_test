description: There's a lot going on in this wine, and all good things. The nose starts with notes of raw meat, bright red fruit, orange peel, baking spice and tar. The first sip reveals a burst of mouthwatering acidity and juicy fruit followed by more intriguing orange rind. It finishes on the savory side. The tannins are grippy but well integrated and while it falls a little flat on the midpalate, overall this is an interesting example of what Central Otago does best..
