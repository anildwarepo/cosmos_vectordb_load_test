Instructions:.
- In a medium bowl, mix together the ground beef, onion, salt and pepper until well blended. Set aside..
- In a large bowl, stir together the flour and salt. Pour in the eggs and milk, and stir until well blended using a sturdy spoon. Form the dough into 2 inch balls, and roll out into circles 1/4 inch thick on a floured surface..
- Form the beef into golf ball sized balls, and place each one onto one half of a dough circle. Fold the other halves of the circles over to enclose the dough. Seal the edges using a saucer or pressing with your fingers..
