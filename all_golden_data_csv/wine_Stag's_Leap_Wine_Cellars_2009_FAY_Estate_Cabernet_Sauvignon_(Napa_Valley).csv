country: US.
description: This delicious 100% Cabernet is supple and generous. The tannins are gentle, the acidity soft yet supportive of the structure, and as for the flavors, they go beyond satisfaction into sheer delight. They include blackberry, cherry, blueberry, currant, mocha and red licorice, but the wine has an earthiness and minerality that give it true complexity. This is Stag's Leap's most accessible 2009 Cabernet, easily earning its high score for sheer delight. Drink nowâ€“2015..
