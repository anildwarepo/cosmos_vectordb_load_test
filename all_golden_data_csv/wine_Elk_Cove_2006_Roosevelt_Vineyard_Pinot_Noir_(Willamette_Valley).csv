country: US.
description: The Roosevelt vineyard bottling goes from strength to strength as it shows nuances of root, sassafras, black cherry and cassis. This vintage is bigger and heavier than previous bottlings, adding sweet fruit but taking away some of the leafy, herbal flavors. Depending upon your attitudes about Pinot Noir and alcohol, you may applaud these changes or bemoan them, but you can't deny it's a delicious bottle with power and structure..
