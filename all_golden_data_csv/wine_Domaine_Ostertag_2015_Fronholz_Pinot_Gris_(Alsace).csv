country: France.
description: The nose suggests utter generosity of ripe juicy pear fruit. The palate enforces this with rounded, aromatic and very pure notes of ripe Bartlett pear. The flavors are precisely drawn, framed by incisive freshness that corsets the richness and gives it a beautiful outline. There is barely concealed strength here and great energy. You can feel the warmth of the sun that ripened these lovely grapes. The finish is lasting and dry. Drink 2017—2030..
