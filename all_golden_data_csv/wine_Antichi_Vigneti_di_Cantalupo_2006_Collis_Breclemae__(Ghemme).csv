country: Italy.
description: The aromatic profile changes continuously in the glass, but includes underbrush, iron, dark spice, rose, tilled earth and a balsamic note. On the firm, radiant palate, an intense mineral vein wraps around dried dark-skinned cherry, cranberry, licorice and chopped herb. A backbone of vibrant acidity and assertive but refined tannins provide structure and impeccable balance. Give this time to soften and develop even more complexity. Drink 2018–2031..
