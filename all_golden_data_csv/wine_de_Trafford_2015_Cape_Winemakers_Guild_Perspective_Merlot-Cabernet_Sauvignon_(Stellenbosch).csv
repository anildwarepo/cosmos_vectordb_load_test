country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: David Trafford. A blend of 67% Merlot and 33% Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with warm, inviting scents of mulberry, blackberry and muddled dark cherry, all hit by spicy accents of fruit cake and cocoa. The medium-weight palate offers more rich, ripe fruit flavors before transitioning to notes of black fruit skin, woodspice and an earthy, graphite-like minerality that flashes vibrantly on the enduring finish. Well balanced, layered and complex, this will only continue to improve as it evolves. Drink 2020â€“2025..
