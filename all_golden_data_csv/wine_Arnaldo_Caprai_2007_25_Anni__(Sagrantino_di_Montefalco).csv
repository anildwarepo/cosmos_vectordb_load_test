wine_Arnaldo_Caprai_2007_25_Anni__(Sagrantino_di_Montefalco),"Unnamed: 0: 88856.
country: Italy.
description: One of the top, if not the top, red wines from Umbria. The naturally tannic Sagrantino grape is softened by the careful oak aging that adds layers of chocolate and spice to the grape's aromas of black cherry, tobacco and leather. This is bold, powerful, masculine and velvety on the finish. Pair it with stewed or grilled meat marinated in rosemary and garlic. Age this in a cellar for 10 years or longer..
