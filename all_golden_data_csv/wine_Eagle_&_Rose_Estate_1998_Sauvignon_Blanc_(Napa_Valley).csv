country: US.
description: A new wine from a new winery. It's actually from a warm easterly section of Napa, Pope Valley, that seems to coax honeydew and watermelon flavors from the grapes. The wine, which is very dry, has been given the royal treatment, with barrel fermentation and extended lees aging, so there's that lovely creamy mouthfeel; malolactic fermentation softens it even more. Pretty lush stuff from a winery to watch..
