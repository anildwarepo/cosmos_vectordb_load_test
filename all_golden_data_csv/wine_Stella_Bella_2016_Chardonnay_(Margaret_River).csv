country: Australia.
description: A great example of Margaret River flexing its Chardonnay muscles, and from a label producing wines of consistent quality and drinkability. Notes of smoke, lemon, melon, vanilla oak and a slight vegetal character lead into a nicely textured palate and a long, smokey finish. The acidity is rather searing at the moment, and the oak a bit apparent, but give this a little time and all will settle into place. Drink nowâ€“2025..
