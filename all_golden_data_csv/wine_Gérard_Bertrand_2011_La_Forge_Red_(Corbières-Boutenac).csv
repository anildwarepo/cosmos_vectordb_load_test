country: France.
description: La Forge is consistently one of Bertrand's top wines, and the 2011 is simply stunning. The dense, heady perfume offers notes of raspberry, black plum, cherry, sweet spice and cocoa powder, which all carry through to the lush, full-weighted palate. The texture is like crushed velvet, with fine yet gripping tannins and ample acidity to keep the mouthfeel fresh. It's a complex and layered wine, with hints of licorice, tobacco leaf and black pepper that grace the finish. Drink 2016–2022..
