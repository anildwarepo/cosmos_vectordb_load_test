Application Description: The LACMA Member Card gives you the ability to carry your member ID with you everywhere you carry your phone—it’s a great way to go green and never have to worry about whether or not you remembered to bring your member ID! Getting started is easy: just enter your member ID number into the app. You’ll get a verification code emailed to you or sent by text message. Don’t know your member ID, or just joined? Input your phone number or email address and we’ll match it to your record and send you the verification code. Show your Member Card at any LACMA Ticket Office for your free tickets, access to Member Previews and Member Mondays, and much more. The LACMA Digital Member Card provides the exact same access to the array of benefits that your plastic card did—all while going green!Read .
