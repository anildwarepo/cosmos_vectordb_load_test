country: US.
description: One large (500 liter) barrel was set aside with wine from a single acre of four interplanted and ungrafted Chardonnay clones. This is truly a natural wine, fermented with no additives, aged on the lees for 18 months, and bottled unfined and unfiltered. Deeply rich flavors of apple pastry, buttery barrel and sweet spice are ineffably long and seductive. This rare and exceptional wine should be consumed in its youth..
