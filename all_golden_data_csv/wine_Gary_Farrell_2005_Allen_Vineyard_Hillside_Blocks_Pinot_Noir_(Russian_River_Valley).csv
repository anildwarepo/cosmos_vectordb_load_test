country: US.
description: Dryness and acidity mark this terrific wine. It's one for connoisseurs, a Pinot that requires some understanding to fully appreciate, as it's not a hedonistic seducer. The cherry and blackberry flavors have a fruit-skin bitterness, and there are additional nuances of violets, cola, leather, balsam and smoky oak. This is certainly one for the cellar. Drink now, with decanting, and over the next eight years..
