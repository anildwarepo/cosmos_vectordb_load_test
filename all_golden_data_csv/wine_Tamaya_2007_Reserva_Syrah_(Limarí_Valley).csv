country: Chile.
description: Limarí is proving itself to be the right region for floral, cool-climate Syrah. This one from Tamaya is minerally and flowery smelling, with bright flavors of black cherry, plum and boysenberry. It's structured and zesty, with good tannic grip and a full finish of kirsch, pepper and coffee. Not outrageous but still one of the best wines we've tried from this producer. Imported by Ecovalley Quality Wine Group and National Refrescos Import Company, LLC..
