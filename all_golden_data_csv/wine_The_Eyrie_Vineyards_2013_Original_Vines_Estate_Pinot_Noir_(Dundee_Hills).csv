country: US.
description: Produced from the oldest Pinot Noir vines in the Willamette Valley, this extraordinary wine is history in a bottle. Glorious aromatics offer intense scents of citrus, pine needle, pepper and berry, with flavors following. There's a welcome kick of citrus in the natural acidity, and this promises a long cellar life, as proven over and over again by this founding Oregon winery. Drink 2020 through 2040 and beyond..
