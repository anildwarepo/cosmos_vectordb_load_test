description: While this takes a while to open up, what follows is worth waiting for. It discloses a rounded richness composed of yeasty layers interspersed with ripe pear, stone fruit and ivy leaves. It also offers shimmers of apricot and juicy, yellow pear, with a more salty verve of grapefruit zest around the edges. Texture and acidity are the twin pillars of structure on this ripe and rounded wine that should be cellared to give its best. Drink from 2018..
