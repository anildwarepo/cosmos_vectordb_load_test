country: US.
description: Winemaker Isabelle Meunier (ex-Evening Land) has carefully selected a handful of sites for her first release of single-vineyard wines under this new label. This is perhaps the most elegant, with exceptional texture, color and overall finesse. Fruits are delicate and detailed, showing watermelon, salmonberry, strawberry and a bit of spice. The 30% new French oak aging adds a gentle kiss of cocoa. Drink now to 2030 and beyond..
