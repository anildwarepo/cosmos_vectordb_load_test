country: France.
description: There is almost a touch of burnt sugar on the nose before the more customary aromas of juicy honeyed pear kick in. There are fresher glints, too, of zesty lime and green pear. The palate boosts the juicy pear notes which fill mouth and nose and which are edged with pleasantly bitter pithiness. A touch of residual sweetness amplifies the fruit on the generous palate, but this is balanced with lemony freshness before an off-dry finish. Lovely now but sure to develop. Drink 2017–2030..
