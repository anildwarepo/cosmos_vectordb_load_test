wine_Knudsen_2014_Chardonnay_(Dundee_Hills),"Unnamed: 0: 122102.
country: US.
description: Just the second Chardonnay release from this revived brand, this is built upon Dijon clones 76 and 95, planted in 1995, and aged for just six months in 20% new French oak. It's young and tight, with compressed core flavors of green apple and grapefruit. There's a hint of gun metal, and it punches down the palate with vivid acidity. If you drink it young, decant it, or give it another three to five years of cellaring. Drink now through 2022..
