country: US.
description: This is an interesting wine, with dense and deep layers of chocolate, licorice and other barrel flavors, buttressed with ripe, clean berry-flavored fruit. The alcohol is in balance, and the aromas carry a mix of wild herb, grass and grain. It's impossible to know where this wine will travel as it ages, but it certainly will light up any dinner party conversation in the near term. Best guess? Drink up soon..
