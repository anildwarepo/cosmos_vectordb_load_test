wine_Soos_Creek_2006_Sundance_Red_Wine_Red_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 103410.
country: US.
description: The Sundance blend in 2006 is two-thirds Merlot, the other third splits Cab Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. It's what the winemaker modestly describes as his “leftovers,” but like the best leftovers it tastes great. It's wide open and broadly appealing, with sweet and soft fruit flavors of ripe berries, cherries and milk chocolate. Along with the ripe, fresh fruit are soft tannins and some pleasing streaks of coffee and licorice..
