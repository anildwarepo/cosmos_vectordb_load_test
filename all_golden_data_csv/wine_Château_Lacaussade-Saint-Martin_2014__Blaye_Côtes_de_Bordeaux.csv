country: France.
description: Though 60% Sémillon and 40% Sauvignon Blanc, this wine reflects herbaceous Sauvignon in style. It is lightly perfumed while also having intense acidity. The aftertaste, all fresh fruit, conveys a lifted green-fruit character. Drink now. In 1991, enologist Jacques Chardat bought the estate where 19th-century windmills (moulins) still stand above the Gironde Estuary. Consulting enologist is Eric Delacroix..
