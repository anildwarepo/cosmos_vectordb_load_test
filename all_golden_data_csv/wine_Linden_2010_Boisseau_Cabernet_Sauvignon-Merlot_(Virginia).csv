country: US.
description: On first sniff, the French oak veneers the underlying brooding scent of black currant preserves. But with patience, the oak integrates to reveal details of incense, cumin seed and cocoa. This blend features a lush mouthfeel, which is bolstered by mighty tannins that act as a crescendo across the palate. It's a bruiser of a wine, yet despite the elevated alcohol it feels balanced and maintains superb finesse. Give it an hour or two in a decanter or several years in a cellar..
