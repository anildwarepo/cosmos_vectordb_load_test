country: Austria.
description: Breezily aromatic notes of juniper, cypress and lemon zest overlay ripe and juicy peach tones on the nose. The palate is centered on pink grapefruit peel, with a toned, concentrated body that buffers the fresh acidity and delivers a softer style. Everything is tightly held, as in a bud that still needs to open. This is a wine for the long run. Future pleasures are indicated by those multifaceted aromas. Ready from 2016..
