country: US.
description: The descriptor Deep Red perfectly captures the essence of this blend of Petite Sirah, Zinfandel, Syrah and Grenache. It's rich and full-bodied, with expressive, complex red wine flavors of red and black currants, spiced red plums, crushed pepper and hints of dark chocolate and anise. The tannic structure is wonderfully soft and intricate. Drink this beautiful wine now and for the next several years..
