case_title: Erica Deeral (on behalf of herself and the Gamaay Peoples) and others v Gordon Charlie and others [1997] FCA 1408.
case_text: In this proceeding, Walmbaar Aboriginal Corporation (""Walmbaar"") applies under ss 50(2) and 61 (1) of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (""the Act"") for a determination of the compensation payable under the Act in respect of acts which are said to have either extinguished or significantly impaired or otherwise affected the native title rights and interests of the Dingaal People determined by the Court on 8 December 1997 ( Erica Deeral (on behalf of herself and the Gamaay Peoples) and others v Gordon Charlie and others [1997] FCA 1408 per Beaumont J). That determination is described as the Hopevale determination as, by its terms, the Court determined the native title rights and interests subsisting in 13 clans of indigenous people including the Dingaal People in land and waters on the eastern side of Cape York surrounding the community of Hopevale. The land the subject of the determination is described in the Deed of Agreement filed in support of the application for the Hopevale determination under s 87(1) of the Act as the ""land and waters of the Hopevale Deed of Grant in Trust ('the dogit land'), to the high water mark"" as detailed on a map attached to the Deed. It seems to be common ground that the land and waters of the Hopevale determination fall within Lot 35 on Crown Plan BS 222. Walmbaar is a registered native title body corporate in relation to the Hopevale determination, for the purposes of the Act (ss 253 and 193 (2)(e)) and is the prescribed body corporate and agent for the Dingaal People for the purposes of ss 57(2) and 57 (3) of the Act and the Hopevale determination. The ""Rules"" of the Walmbaar Aboriginal Corporation contain these provisions. INTERPRETATION 2. In these Rules - ... ""Common Law Holders"" means each of the persons set out in attached schedule ""A"" provided such persons are, and only whilst they remain, a member of the Corporation. Those listed in the schedule are all adult persons who hold native title under Federal Court determination QG 174 of 1997 , in the case of Deeral v Charlie . ""DINGAAL COUNTRY"" is land, waters, sea and islands traditionally owned by the Dingaal people, in the vicinity of Cape Flattery in far north Queensland; in accordance with the custom and tradition of the Dingaal people. ""DINGAAL CLAN"" and ""DINGAAL People"" and ""DINGAAL community"" mean all persons born of a Dingaal father, or Aboriginal children adopted by a Dingaal father.

""DINGAAL Family"" means Yoren, and/or Baru and/or Charlie families of Hope Vale and their patrilineal descendants.

SCHEDULE ""A"" WALMBAAR ABORIGINAL CORPORATION list of members and adult common law holders Rodney Yoren Kevin Yoren Mervin Yoren Belinda Yoren Margaret Gregory Vernon Yoren Elaine McGreen Susan Bally Christine Yoren Vernon (Ned) Yoren Alwyn Yoren Jacklyn Yoren Gary Yoren Eugene Yoren Roy Yoren Warren Yoren Grace Yoren Norris Baru Phillip Baru Amanda Baru Elaine Baru Margaret Baru Pam Baru Henry Baru Kenny Baru Rita Harrigan Phyllis Greenway Gordon Charlie Patricia Charlie Stanley Charlie Dan Charlie Louie Charlie John Charlie Allan Charlie These individuals listed in Schedule A are the leading members of the Baru, Yoren and Charlie families. Each of the indigenous respondents other than Brian Cobus is a member of Walmbaar. On 25 February 2002, Beaumont J made a further order in the Hopevale determination proceeding directing, by Order 5, that Walmbaar ""is the prescribed body corporate which, after becoming a registered native title body corporate, will perform the functions mentioned in s 57(3) of the Native Title Act 1993 for the Dingaal Clan"". The reason for the long delay between that order and the Hopevale determination of 8 December 1997 is not clear. Differences of opinion emerged between Gordon Charlie and others on the one hand and members of the Baru and Yoren families on the other as to whether the Dingaal People comprise descent members of the Baru and Yoren families notwithstanding the definitional matters contained in the Rules of Walmbaar ([16], Interpretation). For example, a notice convening a meeting for 21 June 2005 of ""all Dingaalwarra and Biddi-Baru members"" to be held at ""Gungarde Office"" in Cooktown was issued to Walmbaar members signed by Gordon Charlie at which meeting a resolution was to be proposed that Phillip Baru, Elaine McGreen and all Baru and Yoren members be expelled from Walmbaar and that ""all Yoren and Baru descent members who are members of [Walmbaar] resign [their membership] as they belong to another clan and are not Dingaal clan descendents"". The notice contained a pro forma notice of resignation and a commentary that Baru and Yoren family members are members of a separate clan called the Biddi-Baru clan. The meeting did not take place. Neither Phillip Baru nor Elaine McGreen nor any member of the Baru and Yoren families resigned their membership of Walmbaar. Consistent with the notion that Baru and Yoren family members form part of a different clan, steps were taken in 2005 to incorporate under the ACA Act a corporation described as Biddi-Baru Aboriginal Corporation which by rule 2 of its Rules defines native title holders in respect of relevant land as members of the Baru and Yoren families from the Cape Flattery area. Mr Testro, a legal officer employed by the Land Council, deposes in his affidavit that members of the Baru and Yoren families did not establish the Biddi-Baru Corporation; they continue to assert membership of Walmbaar on the footing that they are members of the Dingaal clan as recited in the Rules of Walmbaar; and they are seeking to establish who caused the new corporation to be formed on that footing..
