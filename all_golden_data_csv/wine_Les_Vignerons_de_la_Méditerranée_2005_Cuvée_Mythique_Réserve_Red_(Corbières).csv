description: With 250 cases imported, this Reserve is easier to acquire, half the price and almost as satisfying as the brand's Limited Release offering. Loaded with influence of the surrounding garrigue, including bay leaves and sage, aromas and flavors of black cherries, plum skin, violets and tar also abound. Velvety in texture and full in the mouth with a long, evolving finish that ends on a divine mocha note..
