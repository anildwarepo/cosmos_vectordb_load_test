First Page Reviews: I had high hopes but was disappointed. After the 4th or 5th painting, the numbers no longer lined up. And it was pretty tough to find the paintings in numerical order.

After the 4th or 5th painting, the numbers no longer lined up. And it was pretty tough to find the paintings in numerical order. After painting number 8 I think it was, the next one over was like 36. And it's not easy to go from 8 to 36 in the app...that's 32 very slow swipes. I spent way too much time staring at my phone and trying to find the right painting to go with the narration in the app. It would have been a richer experience without the app. Playing audio required holding phone to ear even when earphones were plugged in.

I could see the experience in others phones and hopefully redownloading allows it...Full ReviewNew AR exhibit doesn't work the way it should.
