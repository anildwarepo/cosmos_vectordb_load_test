wine_Heintz_2007_Syrah_(Sonoma_Coast),"Unnamed: 0: 93606.
country: US.
description: An interesting and different Syrah, and a promising release from a young brand to watch. The wine is very high in acidity, giving it a firm grip. The flavors are tremendously rich, offering a tsunami of blackberries, currants, plum sauce, baker's chocolate, leather, grilled meat, pine nut and black pepper. It's youthfully aggressive right now in tannins, and needs time for all the serious parts to marry. Leave it alone until sometime in 2010, and it should haul for years after..
