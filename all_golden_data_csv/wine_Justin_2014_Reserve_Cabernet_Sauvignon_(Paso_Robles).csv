country: US.
description: Lush aromas of cinnamon, black and red cherry, vanilla and toasted brioche show on this unabashedly potent and downright delicious bottling by the region's pioneering winery. Soft tannins joyously present rounded red-fruit and vanilla-cake flavors, with rich accents of cherry compote and chocolate chip cookie that are cut by streaks of bitterness and tartness. It's a voluptuous, attention-grabbing wine..
