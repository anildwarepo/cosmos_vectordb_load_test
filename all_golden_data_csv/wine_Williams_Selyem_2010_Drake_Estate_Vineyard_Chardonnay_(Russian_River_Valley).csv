country: US.
description: Winemaker Bob Cabral's three 2010 Chardonnays are possibly the greatest he's ever made. This bottling shows fabulous complexity and sheer deliciousness, offering intricate notes of butterscotch, tropical fruit, pear tart, golden apricot, vanilla cream, buttered toast and exotic spice, with perhaps just a trace of honey. Its brilliant acidity and a tangy minerality provide the balance that pushes this wine off the charts..
