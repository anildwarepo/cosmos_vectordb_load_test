country: France.
description: Lifted aromas of both tart and ripe green and yellow apples appear, alongside hints of wet pebble and faint notions of quince. On the palate, these flavors are wrapped in citrus freshness on a sprightly, lively, concentrated and wonderfully dry palate. This is full of life and finishes on a pervasive, all-encompassing zesty lemon freshness. Lovely now but will evolve majestically. Drink now through 2035..
