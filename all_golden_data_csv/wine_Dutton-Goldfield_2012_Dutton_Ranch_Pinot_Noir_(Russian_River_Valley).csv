country: US.
description: This is the winery's first Pinot of the vintage. Hence it's a preview of their 2012s to come, and what promise it holds. The acidity is high and the alcohol is low, making for an elegant mouthfeel. But what's especially pleasurable are the deep flavors of black cherries, blueberries, red currants and sandalwood. The wine is fine to drink now, and should hold in the bottle until 2022. What a superb barbecued steak pairing..
