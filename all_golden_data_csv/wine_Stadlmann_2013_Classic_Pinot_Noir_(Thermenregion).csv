wine_Stadlmann_2013_Classic_Pinot_Noir_(Thermenregion),"Unnamed: 0: 125857.
country: Austria.
description: The scent of very ripe, crunchy Bing cherries is heady at first. On the palate, red cherry fruit dominates the soft, pliant and lighter body, fringed by pleasant earthiness. This is Pinot Noir in a very Central European idiom: Not weighed down with heavy oak but confident enough to let fruit and place speak for itself. This is elegant and soft, light-bodied yet ripe. If you listen to this, it will slowly reveal its undoubted beauty..
