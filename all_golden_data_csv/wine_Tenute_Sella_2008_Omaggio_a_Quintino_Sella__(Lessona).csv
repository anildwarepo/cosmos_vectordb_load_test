description: The layers of aromas and flavors in this beautifully delineated blend of Nebbiolo and 15% Vespolina include dried wild cherry, white pepper, leather, violet, rose, underbrush, savory herb, licorice and baking spice. Fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity balance the savory flavors and a vein of energizing minerality closes the lingering finish. It's gorgeous and loaded with finesse. Drink 2016–2028..
