country: US.
description: A star even among a stellar group of 2012 releases from Elk Cove, this 20-year-old vineyard really delivers the goods. Time has tempered the herbal aromatics, giving this rich, ripe effort a subtle subtext of olive and sage. Black cherry, dark chocolate and a dusty, mocha finish with a hint of habanero pepper bring this wine together beautifully. Delicious already, it should continue to improve 2025–2030..
