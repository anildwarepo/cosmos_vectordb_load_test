country: Canada.
description: West of the Okanagan valley, Similkameen Valley is being touted as the next great Canadian wine region. If these first releases from Vanessa are typical, they are right on track. This Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cab Franc blend is a supple and sensuous wine, with well-integrated flavors of fig, black cherry, brambly berry, roasted coffee and mocha. It's sturdy, layered and balanced, with a hint of smoke from aging 18 months in a mix of French and American oak..
