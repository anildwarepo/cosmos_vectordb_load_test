country: US.
description: Here is another great value from the Milbrandt brothers, based upon their impeccable vineyard sources (they own 1600 acres, mostly in the Wahluke Slope AVA). Dense and dark, ripe and compact, this Cab/Merlot/Petit Verdot blend brings plenty of macho and muscle, layers of black fruits, black smoke, black tea and black olives. Get the idea? It's a beautiful effort, and really shines at this price point..
