country: US.
description: A stunning and unusual white wine out of Lodi made by Jim Moore, with tremendous aromatics of honeysuckle and melon and a genius balancing between sweetness and acidity. Grapes—technically Moscato Giallo—were harvested from the Bella Vigna Vineyard fully ripe but at low brix, allowing this bottling to maintain a very low 12% alcohol level. An amazing deal for a wine that jumps out of the glass, all bright and starry eyed..
