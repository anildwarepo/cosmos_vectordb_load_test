country: US.
description: Winemaker Laurent Montalieu really shines with Pinot Gris, and the vibrant nose and lush textures of his 2006 Soléna continue an unbroken string of successes. Packed with fresh pear fruit, annotated with pineapple and laced with vanilla, this delicious wine keeps resonating through the palate and into a lively, spicy finish. No malolactic fermentation, no oak. Just a lovely expression of great fruit..
