description: One of the most remarkable things about the J.J. Prüm wines is their ability to marry richness with lightness, and that's well displayed in this auslese. The aromas are funky-stinky at first, yet with aeration those scents merge with tropical fruit to become an indescribably complex, seamless whole. Extremely long on the finish, with echoes of passion fruit lingering for minutes afterward. Drink now-2040..
