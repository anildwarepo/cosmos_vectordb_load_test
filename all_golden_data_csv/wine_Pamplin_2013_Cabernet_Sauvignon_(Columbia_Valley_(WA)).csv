wine_Pamplin_2013_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 109923.
country: US.
description: Though not labeled as such, this 100% varietal all hails from Red Mountain, with the fruit coming from Klipsun (64%), Scooteney Flats and Tapteil vineyards. The aromas are brooding and locked up at present with notes of mineral, black currant, spice, pencil lead and blackberry. The fruit flavors are black as night, supported by firm but exceptionally well-integrated tannins. It will be at its best from 2023 to 2031 but should last well beyond that..
