Description: For most of the 20th century, the work of cartoonist and graphic novelist Will Eisner defined the art of comic book storytelling in the U.S. and throughout the world. Still prolific today at the age of 86, Eisner is the embodiment of ""living legend"" in the world of comic books, continuing to produce some of the most innovative and influential work in the medium. This all-new hardcover collection of Eisner's gorgeous pencil sketches and groundbreaking designs is a must-have for pop-culture enthusiasts and fans of comic books. Culled from many decades' worth of work, the Sketchbook presents the world as seen through Will Eisner's eyes, with introductory notes for each of the eleven different sections. From his observations of his friends and loved ones hustling through their busy daily lives to witnessing those quiet moments when no one is supposed to be watching, Eisner's keen perception and steadfast hand capture the essence of what it means to be alive..
