short_description: <p>Remarkable as a landscape shaped over three centuries of coal extraction from the 1700s to the 1900s, the site consists of 109 separate components over 120,000&nbsp;ha. It features mining pits (the oldest of which dates from 1850) and lift infrastructure, slag heaps (some of which cover 90&nbsp;ha and exceed 140&nbsp;m in height), coal transport infrastructure, railway stations, workers&rsquo; estates and mining villages including social habitat, schools, religious buildings, health and community facilities, company premises, owners and managers&rsquo; houses, town halls and more. The site bears testimony to the quest to create model workers&rsquo; cities from the mid 19th century to the 1960s and further illustrates a significant period in the history of industrial Europe. It documents the living conditions of workers and the solidarity to which it gave rise.</p>.
