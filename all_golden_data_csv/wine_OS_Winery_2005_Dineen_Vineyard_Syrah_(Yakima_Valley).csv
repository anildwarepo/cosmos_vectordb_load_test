country: US.
description: Dark, sappy and syrupy, this jet-black, 100% Syrah mixes superconcentrated raspberry compote with espresso, smoke and hints of pepper bacon. There is nothing shy here, but the wine is authoritative and splashy, a Syrah that does not taste like all the other Syrahs made in Washington. Despite alcohol levels just under 15% the wine keeps its shape and its detail, and the tannins are smooth and polished. A fine effort from winemaker Bill Owen..
