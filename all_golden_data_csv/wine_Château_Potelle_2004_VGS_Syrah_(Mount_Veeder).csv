country: US.
description: This is the best Potelle Syrah I've ever had, but be forewarned: It's an extraordinarily tannic wine that shows its 1,800-foot mountain origins. It clocks in at 13.9% alcohol, yet it's bone dry. The fruit is powerfully concentrated in blackberries enhanced with sweet, smoky oak. If ever there was a Syrah for the cellar, this is it. Best now (if you like young tannic wines, but please decant) and for at least eight years, as it gradually mellows..
