wine_Vollereaux_NV_Brut_Rosé_de_Saignée_Pinot_Noir_(Champagne),"Unnamed: 0: 32823.
country: France.
description: This is an unusual rosé for Champagne. It is made 100% from Pinot Noir rather than a blend. And it is made by getting color directly from the fermenting grapes rather than the normal Champagne process of adding red wine. The result is a dark-colored rosé that has a tannic structure as well as red fruits. It is rich and concentrated with ripeness rather than great freshness. It is definitely a food wine..
