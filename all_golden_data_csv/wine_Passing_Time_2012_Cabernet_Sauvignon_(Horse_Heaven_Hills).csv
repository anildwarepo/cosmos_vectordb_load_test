country: US.
description: This inaugural release from former NFL quarterbacks Dan Marino and Damon Huard is a blend of 86% Discovery Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Klipsun Merlot and 5% Champoux Cabernet Franc. It's aromatically brooding at kickoff, with notes of dark coffee, dusty earth and cherry. The soft, smooth cherry and coffee flavors will benefit from additional time in the bottle, as this wine is more about elegance than sheer power. Give it until 2025â€“2030 to see it at its best; it has the stuffing to get there..
