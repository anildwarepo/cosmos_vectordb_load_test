country: Austria.
description: Ripe pear shot through with savory notes of lovage and yeast create an appetizing nose. The palate holds the same savory dimension but is streamlined by welcome, citric freshness reminiscent of grapefruit peel. A phenolic component makes for real mouthfeel and texture—one of the characteristic joys of Grüner. This is a tight little bomb waiting to go off. It will do so in great fashion from about 2018..
