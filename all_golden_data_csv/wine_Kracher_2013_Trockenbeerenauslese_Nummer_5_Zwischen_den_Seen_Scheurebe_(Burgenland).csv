country: Austria.
description: Candied lime and lemon zest are bathed in the rich honey notes of full-blown botrytis. This lifted scent is more than heady and continues intensely on the lusciously sweet palate. Candied quince and mandarin peel run circles round honeycomb and apricot jam which swirls around your brain like a psychedelic dream in all its apricot glory. There is something otherworldly about this wine, something ambrosial and decadent, made all the more so by its apparent weightlessness. What a triumph..
