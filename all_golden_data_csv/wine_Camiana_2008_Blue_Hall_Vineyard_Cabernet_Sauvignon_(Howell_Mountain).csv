country: US.
description: Camiana has been establishing a real track record with this bottling, and the 2008 is the best yet. It shows the intensity and purity of Howell Mountain fruit, bearing deep flavors of blackberries, blueberries, dark chocolate and currants, with big, firm tannins that are characteristic of the mountain. There's also a softness and a femininity that make the wine drinkable now, but it should easily develop over the next decade, at the very least..
