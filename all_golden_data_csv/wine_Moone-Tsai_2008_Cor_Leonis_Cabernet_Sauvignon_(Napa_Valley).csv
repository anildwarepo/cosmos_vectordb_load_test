country: US.
description: The question concerning this wine isn't whether or not it's very goodâ€”it is. Instead, it's about ageability. Made from 100% Cabernet grown in two very different places, Pritchard Hill and Coombsville, it's dry and refined. Floods the mouth with blackberry, blueberry, cassis, dark chocolate, spice and new oak flavors whose richness is tempered by a firm minerality. Really fabulous in all respects, but so delicious now, it makes you wonder why you should even risk more than six years in the cellar..
