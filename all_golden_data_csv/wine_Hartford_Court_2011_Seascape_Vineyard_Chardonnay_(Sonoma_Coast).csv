country: US.
description: This is one of the most dramatic Chardonnays of the vintage, which was a difficult one owing to the coldest summer in many years. Somehow, Hartford Court's viticulturalists pulled it off. There's no trace of the greenness or unripeness that mark some other '11 Chards. Instead, you'll find waves of awesomely ripe apricots, tangerines and pears, enriched with smoky oak and brightened with brisk acidity. Terrific now and over the next 4â€“5 years..
