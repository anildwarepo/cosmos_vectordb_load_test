country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Neil Ellis. A blend of 70% Tempranillo and 30% Grenache, this leads with forward scents of pressed carnation, small strawberry, raspberry sauce and licorice, with a subtle hit of fudgy chocolate. The palate is big and powerful, with firm tannins and tight black-fruit flavors that suggest some aging would be of benefit. Notes of black-cherry skin, black tea and espresso hang on tightly to the chewy finish. Drink 2020â€“2026..
