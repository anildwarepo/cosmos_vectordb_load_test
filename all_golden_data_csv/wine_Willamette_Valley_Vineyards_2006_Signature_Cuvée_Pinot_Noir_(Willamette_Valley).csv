country: US.
description: The Signature Cuvée opens on a floral note, a pretty and beguiling blend of roses and orchids. The midpalate is substantial and textured, offering spicy plum, strawberry and raspberry preserves and firm acids. The fruit flavors persist even as the tannins and barrel notes kick in, offering cocoa, ground coffee and walnut. All in all, an elegant and complex effort that should also age nicely for up to a decade..
