country: Chile.
description: Vel치zquez's most successful and consistent effort is this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah. It's crusty and dark on the nose, with magnanimous baked-fruit, earth and berry aromas. The feel is just right and the wine shows few, if any, faults or breaks. Overall it's pure and fades away with rich, dark flavors and velvety tannins. A New World red wine that's sure to please. 350 cases made..
