country: US.
description: The name references the clone number for this single-clone Cabernet Sauvignon. Since it is also a single-vineyard estate wine, it captures terroir in a meaningful expression. Still young, sharply defined and tannic, it is showing a lot of barrel flavors, especially clove. The Cabernet fruit is right in line with Gordon Brothers style, capturing the herbal aspects of the grape, in perfect balance, with a beautiful mix of cassis, earth and fresh, sweet herb. Very limited..
