Description: A Down-to-Earth Approach James Henslin shares the excitement of sociology with his acclaimed down-to-earth approach and personal writing style. Sociology: A Down-to-Earth Approach, 12/e, highlights the sociology of everyday life and its relevance to students' lives. Six central themes help students stimulate their sociological imagination: down-to-earth sociology, globalization, cultural diversity, critical thinking, the new technology, and the influence of the mass media on our lives. MySocLab is an integral part of the Henslin program. Engaging activities and assessments provide a teaching and learning system that helps students discover sociology in their lives. With MySocLab, students can watch videos on sociological core concepts, explore real-world sociology through the new Social Explorer, and develop critical thinking skills through writing. This title is available in a variety of formats and prices - digital and print. Pearson offers its titles on the devices students love through Pearson's MyLab products, CourseSmart, Amazon, and more..
