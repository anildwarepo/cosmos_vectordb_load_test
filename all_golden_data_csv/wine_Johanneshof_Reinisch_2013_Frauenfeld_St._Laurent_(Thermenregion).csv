wine_Johanneshof_Reinisch_2013_Frauenfeld_St._Laurent_(Thermenregion),"Unnamed: 0: 77406.
country: Austria.
description: Sumptuous notes of fresh, aromatic red cherries are central to this wine. They are joined by a sonorous, soft and mellow oak spice and texture and sprays of fresh white pepper. There are hints of iron oxide and an intensely brooding flavor of pure, black cherry at the very core. This draws you in and just makes you want to savor. Lovely now, this will come out of its shell with some bottle age. Drink 2016–2020..
