wine_Recanati_2006_Reserve_Kosher_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Galilee),"Unnamed: 0: 42877.
country: Israel.
description: With 16 months in French oak, this is a big wine with big flavors. Fleshy black plum guts, black cherry, crushed African violet petals and a touch of tobacco appear in the bouquet, while cherry pit, pepper and cigar spice fill out the palate. Medium weight and lush in the mouth with solid tannins and acidity, this is a good choice now with strong meat dishes or a candidate to hold onto for a couple more years..
