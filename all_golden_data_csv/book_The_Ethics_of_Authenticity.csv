Description: Everywhere we hear of decline, of a world that was better before the influence of modernity. While some lament Western culture's slide into relativism and nihilism and others celebrate the trend as a liberating sort of progress, Taylor calls on us to face the moral and political crises of our time, and to make the most of modernity's challenges..
