country: US.
description: Malbec may well be the next red grape to emerge as a star in Washington State, once the young vines have a few more vintages behind them. This is 100% varietal. Light and elegant, it's nicely detailed with a peppery, floral character and a welcome persistence. Take the best qualities of Beresan's Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Syrah and mix them into a single, more delicate varietal, and you have this lovely Malbec, which glides along to a finish with chocolaty, satiny tannins..
