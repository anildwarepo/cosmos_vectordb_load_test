wine_Moone-Tsai_2009_Cor_Leonis_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Napa_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 90943.
country: US.
description: This wine is entirely Cabernet, using grapes from the southerly Coombsville area and warmer St. Helena. As such, it's wonderfully balanced, with a sprightly burst of acidity brightening succulent flavors of black cherry and dark chocolate. The use of 100% new French oak sounds excessive on paper, but it's perfectly integrated, providing a jacket of sweet buttered toast that in no way overshadows the fruit. Enjoy it now and over the next 10 years as it ages..
