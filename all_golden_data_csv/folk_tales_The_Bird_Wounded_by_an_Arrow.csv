title: The Bird Wounded by an Arrow.
text: A bird, with plumèd arrow shot,In dying case deplored her lot:“Alas!” she cried, “the anguish of the thought!This ruin partly by myself was brought!Hard-hearted men! from us to borrowWhat wings to us the fatal arrow!But mock us not, ye cruel race,For you must often take our place.”The work of half the human brothersIs making arms against the others..
