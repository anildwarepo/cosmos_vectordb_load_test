wine_Matriarch_2006_Red_(Napa_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 124447.
country: US.
description: Matriarch often measures up to the level of BOND and Harlan Estate itself. It is a blend of various BOND components. The '06 is a classically structured Napa blend, fat and flashy in youth, offering complex waves of blackberry and cherry tart, black currant, cola, licorice and sweet, spicy oak. There's a savory meatiness reminiscent of salty bacon. But the tannins are significant. Drink now through 2018..
