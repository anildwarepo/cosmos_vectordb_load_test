wine_Hightower_2005_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 86105.
country: US.
description: Mostly Red Mountain fruit, this Bordeaux blend also includes about a third of the grapes from Alder Ridge in the Horse Heaven Hills, and a splash of Merlot from Pepper Bridge in Walla Walla. It follows the Hightower style of pretty fruit, ripe tannins and lots of chocolaty notes. In this excellent vintage it retains just a hint of fresh rosemary and black pepper, which contributes some snap to the finish..
