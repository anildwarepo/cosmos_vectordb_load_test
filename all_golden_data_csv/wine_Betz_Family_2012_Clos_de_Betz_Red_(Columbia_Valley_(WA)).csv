wine_Betz_Family_2012_Clos_de_Betz_Red_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 88690.
country: US.
description: Just over two-thirds Merlot with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon and a pinch of Petit Verdot, this thoroughly delicious wine opens with a complex assortment of aromas, including incense, toast, crushed flowers, spice, bay leaf, licorice and red and black fruit. The palate is deft but brings waves of layered fruit flavors that show great density and richness. It's hedonistic but doesn't sacrifice one iota of balance. It drinks best at 62 degrees..
