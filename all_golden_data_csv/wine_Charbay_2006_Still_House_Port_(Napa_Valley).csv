country: US.
description: Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel and Syrah wine that's been aged seven years in French oak and fortified with four-year-old Charbay Syrah brandy, this vintage selection is aromatically stunning in chocolate, tobacco and dried ginger candy notes. Balanced and rich, it finishes semidry, with a viscous taste of almonds and dried cranberries, both of which would make a good pairing, atop a selection of gooey cheeses..
