country: France.
description: Whiffs of red-cheeked mirabelle plum, tart red apple, a touch of earth and vivid tangerine immediately signal pleasure. The absolutely straightlaced, concentrated and dry palate adds hints of quince and blood orange. This is dry, even lean but absolutely powerful with bundled flavor. You can feel heat and energy at the core of this, there is real ripeness and force here, played against absolute, vivid and cleansing freshness. High drama indeed. Let it age a while before playing it out. It will be worth the wait. Drink 2022–2037..
