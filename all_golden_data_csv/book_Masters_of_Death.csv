Description: The Pulitzer Prize-winning historian challenges traditional interpretations of the Holocaust in a study that describes the role of the Einsatzgruppen, task forces deployed in Eastern Europe by the SS, whose job was to slaughter Eastern European Jews, the development of less personalized means of murder, and Hitler's eventual plans to annihilate members of other ethnic groups.
