country: France.
description: Since taking over a family estate in 1998, Cathy and Daniel Fournié have focused on making great wine with the help of their expert neighbors. This is the result. Produced from organic, low-yielding old vines and wood aged for nearly two years, the wine is concentrated and dense. Mint flavors show the new wood and give a polished edge to the black fruit. Powerful tannins and juicy acidity back up its fruitiness. This is a wine for long-term aging. Drink from 2023..
