description: A blend of 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Merlot, 13% Malbec, 11% Cabernet Franc and 5% Petit Verdot, this stunning, well-balanced wine will reward patience. Dark and dense, it's a powerful selection that boasts serious fruit concentration and a full, firm structure, with mouthcoating tannins. The black-fruit core is accented by notes of leather, fresh mint, pepper, char and bittersweet cocoa. Additional nuance and layers of complexity will develop with time; drink 2016-2020..
