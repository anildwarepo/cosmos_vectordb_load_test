country: Spain.
description: For a few years running we've been singing the praises of Abadal, a label from Catalonia that has been producing hit upon hit. This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah from the excellent 2001 vintage is in super form; the wine has a ripe, integrated nose of cocoa, dark fruit and chocolate, while the palate is bold and loaded with vivacious cherry and blackberry flavors. From front to center to back, this wine has it all going in the right direction. Good now through 2012..
