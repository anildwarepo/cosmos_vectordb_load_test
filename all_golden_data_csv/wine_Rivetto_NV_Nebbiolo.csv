wine_Rivetto_NV_Nebbiolo,"Unnamed: 0: 67643.
country: Italy.
description: Made entirely with Nebbiolo, this unique table wine is entirely vinified and aged in terracotta amphora. Lithe and vibrant, the aromas change continuously in the glass, opening with intense scents of ripe raspberry, blue flower and baking spice that segue into aromas of tilled soil, leather and balsamic notes of eucalyptus and menthol. The savory palate offers tart cherry, cinnamon, licorice, white pepper and mineral alongside glossy tannins that give it a smooth polished texture..
