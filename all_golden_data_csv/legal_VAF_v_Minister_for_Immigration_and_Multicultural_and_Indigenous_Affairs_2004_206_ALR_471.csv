case_title: VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471.
case_text: There is no reason to doubt that 'information' in s 424A(1) is used in its ordinary sense of knowledge communicated or received concerning some fact or circumstance. In VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471 ("" VAF "") at 476-477 [24], Finn and Stone JJ set out the following propositions about the meaning of the term 'information' in its s 424A(1) setting: ""(i) the purpose of s 424A is to provide in part a statutory procedural analogue to the common law of procedural fairness: Paul v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1196 ; (2001) 113 FCR 396 at 429-30 [104] ; [2001] FCA 1196 ; 64 ALD 289 at 318. However the obligation imposed is not coextensive with that which might be imposed by the common law to avoid practical injustice: VAAC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 74 ; BC200301782; (ii) the word 'information' in s 424A(1) has the same meaning as in s 424; Win v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 56 ; (2001) 105 FCR 212 at 218 [20] ; and in this setting it refers to knowledge of relevant facts or circumstances communicated to or received by the Tribunal: Tin v Minister for Immigration and Indigenous Affairs [2000] FCA 1109 ; BC200004607 at [3]; irrespective of whether it is reliable or has a sound factual basis: Win , at 217-18 [19]-[22]; and (iii) the word does not encompass the Tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations: Tin at [54]; Paul at FCR 428 [95]; ALD 317; Singh v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1679 ; BC200107472 at [25]; approved [2002] FCAFC 120 ; BC200203793; nor does it extend to identified gaps, defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the Tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps, etc: WAGP of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 266 ; (2002) 124 FCR 276 at 282-4 [26] - [29] ."" The third proposition has not been doubted but its application has produced some fine distinctions. 40 In VAF , Finn and Stone JJ at 478 [33] said that, in applying s 424A, it is necessary to differentiate between the integral and inessential parts for the reasons for the Tribunal's decision. Ultimately, the test which Finn and Stone JJ applied in VAF (at 481 [41]) was whether the information in question was so integral to the reasoning process rejecting the appellant's claim as to require, as a matter of fairness, that the appellant be told that information and why it was relevant to the review. 44 In SZECF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1200 , the appeal arose from a Tribunal decision which had found that the applicant for a protection visa had fabricated his claim and various documents submitted in support of it. In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal relied upon the fact that the applicant's written statement to the Department did not mention the claims of persecution that the Tribunal ultimately rejected. One of the issues that arose on the appeal to this Court was whether s 424A applied to the information contained in the applicant's original statement to the Department. After referring to VAF, Paul and WAGP , Allsop J at [26] and [34] held that it did: ""I have extracted earlier the places in the Tribunal's reasons where the prior statement is used. Having read the whole of the reasons of the Tribunal, it is clear that the comprehensive disbelief of the appellant and the finding that he had brought forward fraudulent documentation was largely, if not wholly, a product of the importance placed by the Tribunal on the form and content of his first statement. In short, the Tribunal found that if what he was saying were true, it would have been referred to earlier. The fact that it was not, demonstrated the falsity of his evidence to the Tribunal. ... In my view, here, the knowledge of the Tribunal of the content of the earlier statement, including the limits of its contents can be seen to be a part of the reason for the decision because its form and content were instrumental in the Tribunal reaching a conclusion that the oral evidence of the appellant was false and the documents he was propounding were fraudulent."" In Allsop J's view, the case before him involved something more than what Finn and Stone JJ in VAF at 476-477 [24] had called 'identified gaps, defects or lack of detail or specificity' in evidence given to the Tribunal, or what the Full Court in WAGP had described as a failure to mention something in evidence given to the Tribunal. 48 Moore J adopted and applied what had been said by Finn and Stone JJ in VAF : see SZEEU at [22] [25]. In his Honour's view, the flight information was not of sufficient significance to warrant a conclusion that it formed part of the Tribunal's reasons for affirming the decision of the Minister's delegate. This was because it was a subsidiary and peripheral reason which the Tribunal relied upon to reject the applicant's claim that charges were outstanding against him in Bangladesh. Other factors referred to by the Tribunal were of greater significance. As for the similar claims information, Moore J noted that the Tribunal only referred to this information after analysing and rejecting the applicant's central claims. In his Honour's view, the Tribunal therefore rejected the central claims of the appellant by a process of reasoning not dependent on the similar claims information: see SZEEU at [27]-[28]. 50 Allsop J held that the test which had been advanced in Paul and VAF had to be reconsidered in the light of the High Court's decision in SAAP . His Honour said that, to the extent that Paul and VAF both include notions of fairness derived from the rules of procedural fairness as part of the analysis of whether something is part of the reason for affirming the decision, those decisions are in conflict with the approach of the majority of the High Court in SAAP . In consequence, his Honour set out what he thought that the approach to be adopted in the future should be at [215]: ""In my view, in the light of SAAP , in circumstances where one is faced with a decision of the Tribunal with reasons and the complaint is a contravention of s 424A(1), the question to ask, by reference to the reasons of the Tribunal in the context in which one find them (as revealing what would be the reason or a part of the reason for affirming the decision immediately prior to the making of the decision), is whether the information in question was a part (that is any part) of the reason for affirming the decision. To the extent that the reasons of the relevant majorities in Paul and VAF can be seen to require that the relevant part of the reason have a stature or importance, or be of a character which would make it unfair not to invoke the procedures of s 424A, I think SAAP requires that such an approach be rejected. It is only necessary that the information be a part of the reason."" The application of these principles by the majority in SZEEU necessarily led to the conclusion that both the flight information and the similar claims information fell squarely within s 424A. It was sufficient that both pieces of information were referred to and relied upon by the Tribunal as relevant and operative considerations, whether or not they could be described as a subsidiary or a minor part of the reason for the Tribunal's decision. 62 In applying s 424A , it is necessary to focus on matters that, viewed prospectively, would be the reason or a part of the reason for the Tribunal's decision, or viewed retrospectively in the light of the Tribunal's actual decision, can be seen to be the reason, or a part of the reason, for the Tribunal's decision. At the outset of the Tribunal hearing and prior to the appellant's evidence to the Tribunal, I doubt that the Keskin information could be characterised as information that the Tribunal then considered, or might consider, would be the reason or a part of the reason for affirming the delegate's decision. By itself, the Keskin information was not adverse to the appellant. Numerous cases suggest that s 424A is concerned with information that is adverse to the interests of the visa applicant: see SAAP per McHugh J at 175 [50]; VAF per Finn and Stone JJ at 476-477 [24]; WAJR v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 204 ALR 624 per French J at 637 [57]; and M17/2004 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005) 85 ALD 597 per Ryan J at 615-616 [79] [83]. The Keskin information was simply factual information that might assist in testing the extent of the appellant's knowledge of the activities of the HRA in Turkey and the veracity of her claims. The same picture is presented when the matter is viewed retrospectively in the light of the Tribunal's reasons. The Tribunal attached some significance to the fact that in her evidence to the Tribunal the appellant displayed a lack of knowledge of the Keskin information, amongst other matters. In my opinion, the Keskin information cannot be characterised as the reason, or as a part of the reason, for the Tribunal's affirmation of the decision under review. 70 There is, in my opinion, a valid distinction between the HRA letter and the Tribunal's subjective evaluation of the weight that should be attached to it in the light of the appellant's oral evidence to the Tribunal. Such a distinction is supported by VAF per Finn and Stone JJ at 476-477 [24]; WAGP per Marshall, Weinberg and Jacobson JJ at 282-283 [26] [29]; Tin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2000] FCA 1109 per Sackville J at [53] [54]; and Singh v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 120 per Carr, Moore and Marshall JJ. It is also consistent with the statutory purpose of s 424A , which (to paraphrase the language of Allsop J in Paul at [104]) is to ensure that the applicant is fairly informed of information adverse to his or her case so that investigation may be made, and steps may be taken, if possible, to meet it. By itself, the HRA letter was not the reason, or a part of the reason, for the Tribunal's affirmation of the delegate's decision. Nor was there any point of time prior to the Tribunal's decision at which the Tribunal would have considered that the HRA letter might have constituted the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the delegate's decision. It follows that the HRA letter does not fall within the scope of s 424A..
