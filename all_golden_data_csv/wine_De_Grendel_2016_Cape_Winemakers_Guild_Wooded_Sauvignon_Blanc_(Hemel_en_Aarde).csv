country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Charles Hopkins. De Grendel always produces stunning Sauvies, and Winemaker Charles Hopkins' CWG selection is another well-balanced and expressive selection. It leads with green gooseberry, orange pith and melon rind aromas, while the medium-weight palate shows a bit more concentration in banana and melon flesh flavors. Ample acidity lifts the ripe fruit tones and refreshes the finish, which lingers with faint hints of dried grass and toast. Drink nowâ€“2019..
