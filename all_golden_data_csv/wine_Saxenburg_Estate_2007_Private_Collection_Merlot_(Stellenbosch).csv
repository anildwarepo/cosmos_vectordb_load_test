description: There's a dark and moody feel to this wine, with moderately intense aromas of black plum, blackberry, violet and black licorice. The mouth is robust and fairly full with a creamy texture and concentrated black fruit flavors accented by notes of pepper and tea leaves. The tannins are firmly structured yet approachable, with the impression of roasted cocoa nibs lingering on the finish. Drink nowâ€“2012..
