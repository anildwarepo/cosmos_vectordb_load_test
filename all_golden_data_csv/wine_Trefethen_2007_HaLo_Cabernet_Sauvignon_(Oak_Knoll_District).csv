country: US.
description: A bit difficult to approach now, this has tight tannins that lock down the wine with astringency. Blended with a little Petit Verdot and Malbec, it slowly reveals massive layers of blackberries, cassis liqueur and dark chocolate, remaining stubbornly tight throughout. Many people will drink it soon with beef, and that's fine, especially with a good decant, but it should reward even more with 8â€“10 years in a proper cellar..
