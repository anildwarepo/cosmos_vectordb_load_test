country: France.
description: Despite the age, this still drinks quite young and tight, with firm tannins and a gripping structure framed against a fleshy black-fruit center. Rich and dense notes of blackberry, boysenberry and plum are laced with hints of cigar spice, licorice and toasted vanilla, and a sweet-wood sensation stays through the long finish. Big in almost every regard, this should continue to age well through 2016..
