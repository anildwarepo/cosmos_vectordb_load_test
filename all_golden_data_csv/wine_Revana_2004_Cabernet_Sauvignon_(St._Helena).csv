country: US.
description: There's a spicy quality to the aroma of this polished Cab, with suggestions of dill, sage, crushed autumn leaves and even Proven√ßal lavender and thyme. It's a unique interpretation of Napa and must come from the vineyard's terroir. In the mouth, notes of herbs and tobacco lead to more savory sweet cherry, currant and vanilla oak flavors. This interesting, even dramatic Cab should develop over the next decade..
