wine_Maysara_2012_Momtazi_Vineyard_Delara_Pinot_Noir_(McMinnville),"Unnamed: 0: 113232.
country: US.
description: This cuvée is made with the oldest block in this biodynamic vineyard. Planted in 1998, all Pommard clone, and given some extra bottle age, it's drinking well at the moment. Spicy cranberry-raspberry soda flavors come with a textural midpalate. There is a significant scent and flavor of tanned leather, which pleases some tasters more than others. That aside, the wine is complex, balanced and reasonably long..
