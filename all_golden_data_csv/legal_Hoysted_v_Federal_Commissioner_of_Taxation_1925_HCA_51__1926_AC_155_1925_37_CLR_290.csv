The respondent Commissioner lodge with the Court and with the taxpayer applicants draft declarations and/or orders giving effect to the reasons for judgment within fourteen days, including orders as to costs. 40 What I have thus far recorded or addressed may be described as embracing the broadly asserted foundations for the Commissioner's strike-out application. Apart from abuse of process, and in relation to the further case of the Commissioner based on issue estoppel, I was referred (indeed by both parties) to the following additional passages in the reasons for judgment of Dixon J in Blair v Curran at 532-533: 'Nothing but what is legally indispensable to the conclusion is thus finally closed or precluded. In matters of fact the issue-estoppel is confined to those ultimate facts which form the ingredients in the cause of action, that is, the title to the right established. Where the conclusion is against the existence of a right or claim which in point of law depends upon a number of ingredients or ultimate facts the absence of any one of which would be enough to defeat the claim, the estoppel covers only the actual ground upon which the existence of the right was negatived. But in neither case is the estoppel confined to the final legal conclusion expressed in the judgment, decree or order ... the judicial determination concludes, not merely as to the point actually decided, but as to a matter which it was necessary to decide and which was actually decided as the groundwork of the decision itself, though not then directly the point at issue. Matters cardinal to the latter claim or contention cannot be raised if to raise them is necessarily to assert that the former decision was erroneous ... In the phraseology of Lord Shaw (in the course of his Lordship's dictum in Hoysted in the Privy Council hereafter referred to and discussed), ""a fact fundamental to the decision arrived at"" in the former proceedings and ""the legal quality of the fact"" must be taken as finally and conclusively established (Hoysted v Commissioner of Taxation [1926] AC 155). But matters of law or fact which are subsidiary or collateral are not covered by the estoppel. Findings, however deliberate and formal, which concern only evidentiary facts and not ultimate facts forming the very title to rights give rise to no preclusion. Decisions upon matters of law which amount to no more than steps in a process of reasoning tending to establish or support the proposition upon which the rights depend do not estop the parties if the same matters of law arise in subsequent litigation'. 42 The doctrine of issue estoppel has been applied in what has been described as a revenue context, as the Commissioner rightly contended. In Hoysted v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1925] HCA 51 ; (1925) 37 CLR 290 (to which reference appears by way of the English authorised report in the dictum I have extracted above from Blair v Curran ), and upon which the Commissioner placed reliance here, the Commissioner was found by the Privy Council to be estopped from asserting that trustees of a deceased estate comprising mainly realty were disentitled to certain concessional deductions as joint owners of that realty under certain land tax legislation. The High Court had earlier held by majority (Knox CJ and Starke J, Higgins J dissenting) that the Commissioner was not estopped from contending that certain beneficiaries of that estate had not become joint owners of the realty for land tax purposes, thereby adding significantly to the land tax concessional entitlements of the deceased estate taxpayer. Prior to that finding, there had been several appellate proceedings which need not be recorded. Lord Shaw in Hoysted provided the following opinion of the Privy Council at 299 in relation to the operation of estoppel in that fiscal context: 'In the opinion of their Lordships it is settled, first, that the admission of a fact fundamental to the decision arrived at cannot be withdrawn and a fresh litigation started, with a view of obtaining another judgment upon a different assumption of fact; secondly, the same principle applies not only to an erroneous admission of a fundamental fact, but to an erroneous assumption as to the legal quality of that fact. Parties are not permitted to begin fresh litigations because of new views they may entertain of the law of the case, or new versions which they present as to what should be a proper apprehension by the Court of the legal result either of the construction of the documents or the weight of certain circumstances. If this were permitted, litigation would have no end, except when legal ingenuity is exhausted. It is a principle of law that this cannot be permitted, and there is abundant authority reiterating that principle. Thirdly, the same principle, namely, that of setting to rest rights of litigants, applies to the case where a point, fundamental to the decision, taken or assumed by the plaintiff and traversable by the defendant, has not been traversed. In that case also a defendant is bound by the judgment, although it may be true enough that subsequent light or ingenuity might suggest some traverse which has not been taken. The same principle of setting parties' rights to rest applies, and estoppel occurs.'.
