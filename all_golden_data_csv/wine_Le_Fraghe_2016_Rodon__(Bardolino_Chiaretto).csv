country: Italy.
description: Made with organically grown grapes and using EU-certified organic cellar practices, this delicious rosato opens with aromas of fragrant wild flower, woodland berry and baking spice. The fresh savory palate offers strawberry, yellow peach, cinnamon, herb and a hint of fennel alongside crisp acidity. A salty mineral note drives the finish. More about mineral energy than fruit, it's a rosé for grown-ups..
