country: South Africa.
description: Part of Sadie's Old Vine Series, this is made with grapes sourced from a bush vine vineyard that dates back to 1974, of a variety that's not exactly common for the country. The resulting wine is pure and focused, offering hints of cassis, sauvage, leather and freshly tilled soil that accent the red berry, plum and cherry core. Fine, fleeting tannins lend an approachable structure to the palate, while earthy notes of black tea, bark and pepper linger on the finish. Drink nowâ€“2019..
