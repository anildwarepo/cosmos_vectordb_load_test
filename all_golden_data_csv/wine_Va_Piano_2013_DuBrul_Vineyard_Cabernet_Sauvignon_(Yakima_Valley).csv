wine_Va_Piano_2013_DuBrul_Vineyard_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Yakima_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 76291.
country: US.
description: This wine is quite locked up at present, with barrel notes of cocoa and vanilla in front of high toned dried herbs, black cherry and dusty earth. The flavors are elegant yet rich, tart and fresh with bright acids and an extended finish. Though the wood occasionally gets a bit out front, it's a very pretty expression of the variety that needs time to fully stretch its legs. Best after 2018 or give it a long decant..
