description: Winemaker: Boela Gerber. This is rich and oaky upfront, with forward scents of honeydew, orange creamsicle, pineapple cake and vanilla bean. Those notes carry through to the medium-bodied palate, alongside notes of wood-grilled peach and toasted walnut that are carried along by a bright seam of orange-flavored acidity. Some time in the cellar will allow the oak to further integrate with the ripe fruit tones; drink 2018â€“2022..
