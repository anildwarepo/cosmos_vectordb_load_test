description: Kungfu Girl has become an iconic Riesling on the strength of its instantly recognizable label, and surpassing quality. At 11% alcohol and 18 g/L residual sugar, it rests comfortably on the fence between dry and off-dry, and is a bulls-eye rendition of Washington Riesling. A dense mix of citrus, apple and tree fruits, enhanced with skin textures and finishing with highlights of honey and tea, this is flat out delicious..
