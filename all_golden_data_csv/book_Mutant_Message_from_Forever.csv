Description: From the bestselling author of 'Mutant Message Down Under' comes a fabulous tale of aboriginal twins, separated at birth, and the search for their roots that takes them halfway across the world. Marlo Morgan weaves the entrancing story of babies Geoff and Beatrice, who are taken from their mother by Christian missionaries. Geoff is sent to a sheep ranch, where he grows up wild, and is then uprooted to the US by an American minister. Beatrice is brought up by nuns in an Australian orphanage where for 18 years she encounters continual racism. The story follows them as they grow into adults and eventually meet again, to discover the different paths their lives have taken. Eventually both twins are reunited with the ageless values and healing wisdom that is their Aboriginal heritage..
