country: US.
description: This is a Yates Conwill vineyard reserve selection, which the winery labels “the best Pinot we made in 2013.” It's right up there, to be sure, with power and elegance to spare. The perfect mix of berry and cherry primary fruit, balanced with natural acidity, was finished with a brief time in new oak, yielding accents of chocolate, nougat and caramel. Released in half-bottles only, so drink it by 2020..
