country: South Africa.
description: A decadent blend of ripe berries and rich oak characterizes this wine; sweet smoke and baking spice mingle harmoniously with notes of mashed raspberry and blackberry, accented by hints of hickory-cured bacon and raw cocoa nibs. The medium-weight mouth is structured and bold, with chewy tannins and heady flavors of plum and berry preserves, roasted coffee and sweet licorice. The finish is long and dry, and although this would certainly benefit from 5â€“10 years of cellaring time, it's approachable now with decanting..
