title: The Dog Chasing a Wolf.
text: A Dog was chasing a Wolf, and as he ran he thought what a fine fellow he was, and what strong legs he had, and how quickly they covered the ground. “Now, there’s this Wolf,” he said to himself, “what a poor creature he is: he’s no match for me, and he knows it and so he runs away.” But the Wolf looked round just then and said, “Don’t you imagine I’m running away from you, my friend: it’s your master I’m afraid of.”.
