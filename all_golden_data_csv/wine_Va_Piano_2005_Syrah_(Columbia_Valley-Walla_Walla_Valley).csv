country: US.
description: Smooth, luscious, dense and brilliant—the color is saturated and superbright—this silky wine has kept the tannins supple and ripe. It captures the essence of young, fresh, spicy Syrah, unadulterated or modified with other grapes. This is tight, firm, sappy, young and a bit relentless in a tough, confident style. Flavors of cranberry and wild raspberry run rampant, with plenty of acid to keep it clean and penetrating..
