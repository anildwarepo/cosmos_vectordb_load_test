Description: Trevayne was a self-made millionaire by the time he was thirty. Then he went into government, carving out a brilliant and honourable career. Now he is head of one of the biggest foundations in the USA. Fearless, intelligent and incorruptible, he thinks no one can touch him... Then his investigation into the 'secret government' leads him beyond the corridors of official power into a nightmare maze where Mafia leaders and 'legitimate' billionaires mix, where even the Presidency can be bought and sold. And where a man like Trevayne can be a dreaded enemy, a duped victim, or maybe - just maybe - a king..
