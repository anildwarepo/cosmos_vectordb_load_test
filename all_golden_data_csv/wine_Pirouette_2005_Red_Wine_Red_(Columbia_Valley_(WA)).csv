country: US.
description: The newest vintage of Long Shadows Pirouette is 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 14% Syrah, 5% Malbec and 4% Cab Franc. Combined with the benefits of a stellar vintage, this is substantial, textural and  complex. The toasty new oak flavors are more than matched by rich layers of berries, cassis and black cherries. It glides into a seductive midpalate, adding flavors of dusty cocoa, espresso liqueur and toasted grain. It would show quite well against California Meritage-style wines costing twice as much..
