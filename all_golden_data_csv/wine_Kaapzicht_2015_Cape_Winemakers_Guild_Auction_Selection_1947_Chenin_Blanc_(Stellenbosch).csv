description: Winemaker: Danie Steytler. Direct and clean aromas of Anjou pear, apple flesh, hay, citrus zest, lime leaf and wet stone greet you on the nose of this attractive old-vine Chenin Blanc. The palate boasts a pleasant weight and richness, but with lifting acidity and bright, citrusy flavors for balance. Notes of fresh hay and soft toast unfold on the finish. It's a joy to drink now, but this harmonious and well-balanced wine will age well through 2022..
