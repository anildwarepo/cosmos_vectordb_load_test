country: US.
description: All the individual parts of this 100% Cabernet are, in a word, gargantuan. Yet somehow the wine maintains its balance. The fruit is unbelievably ripe and powerful, with black currants, plums and chocolate that veer into a slight, Port-like finish. The tannins are thick and mellow, while oak adds rich notes of caramel. The result is a stupendously lush, delicious and heady wine. Hold for up to 15 years..
