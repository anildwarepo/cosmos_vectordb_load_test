country: Spain.
description: The iconoclastic Emilio Rojo produces this five-grape blend from terraced vineyards located in inland Galicia. The wine is lush, rich and shows barrel characteristics and depth. The nose is toasty and alluring, but the real play comes in the mouth, which is healthy as an ox, with layered flavors of baked apple, tropical fruits and honey. Long on the finish, with an appealing texture and fine acidity. In perfect condition now; drink through 2013..
