country: South Africa.
description: This opens with a dense and intensely aromatic nose, boasting forward oak-derived fragrances of vanilla, caramel and sweet spice that are grounded by the black cherry and berry core. Firm tannins and a full structure lend power and grip to the palate, with skin-driven fruit flavors of plum, black cherry and currant. Hints of roasted cocoa nib and charred oak show good staying power on the finish, while ample final acidity offers a slight lift to the close. Drink nowâ€“2018..
