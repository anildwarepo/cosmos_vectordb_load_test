country: France.
description: Lemon-scented Mirabelle notes hover on the nose and turn into fully fledged, ripe plum on the palate where the seam of fresh, enlivening and brightening acidity sets a lively theme. The body is light, the finish is dry and the overall impression is one of light-footed playfulness and ease. You might almost forget to notice the more textured, structured core which underlies all this and will allow it to age beautifully. Drink now through 2025..
