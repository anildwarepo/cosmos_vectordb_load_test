unesco_heritage_The_Great_Wall,"Name: The Great Wall.
short_description: <p>In c. 220 B.C., under Qin Shi Huang, sections of earlier fortifications were joined together to form a united defence system against invasions from the north. Construction continued up to the Ming dynasty (1368â€“1644), when the Great Wall became the world's largest military structure. Its historic and strategic importance is matched only by its architectural significance.</p>.
