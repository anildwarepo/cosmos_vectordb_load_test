wine_Pirouette_2011_Red_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 40296.
country: US.
description: Predominantly Cabernet, this the most interesting and complex of all the Long Shadows red blends. It's an aromatic and compelling wine with mixed scents of brambly berries and a touch of violets. Tannins are compact and fully ripe, with none of the chalky character shown in some other reds from this vintage. The juicy acidity and compact strength suggest that further cellaring will reward your patience..
