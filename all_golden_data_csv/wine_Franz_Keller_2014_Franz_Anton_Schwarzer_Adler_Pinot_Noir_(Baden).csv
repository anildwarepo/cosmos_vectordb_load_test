wine_Franz_Keller_2014_Franz_Anton_Schwarzer_Adler_Pinot_Noir_(Baden),"Unnamed: 0: 107461.
country: Germany.
description: Robust in body yet squarely structured, the Franz Anton shows more ripeness and concentration than the producer's standard-label bottling. Fleshy black cherry and berry flavors are ripe, but are offset by crisp acidity and a shroud of smoke and toast that accents without overwhelming. It's bold and penetrating, with a long finish marked by fine, persistent tannins. Delicious already, but bold enough to improve through at least 2030..
