country: US.
description: Rich but subtle, this medium-bodied wine is not overtly fruity or oaky, but blends complex nuances in an attractive and compelling way. The term “battonage” refers to stirring the lees while the wine ages in barrels or tanks, which can enhance the creamy texture. It smells like vanilla and nutmeg, and tastes creamy and buttery backed by ripe apple and a touch of lemon. It feels rich in texture, elegant rather than bold..
