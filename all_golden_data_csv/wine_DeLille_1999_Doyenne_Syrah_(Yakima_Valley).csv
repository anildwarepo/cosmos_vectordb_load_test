country: US.
description: Here is what all the excitement is about:  a Washington Syrah bursting with dense, thick, textured, rich, ripe fruit, yet not too “jammy.” The acids are there to support all that weight, along with generous amounts of oak. The zippy, berry-laden fruit shines through, then the oak kicks in with an abundance of smoke, coffee and licorice notes. Big, sappy, sensuous and flat-out sensational wine. Editors' Choice..
