More than 240 battleships were involved in this showdown between British and German naval forces. In the space of just a day, 25 vessels fell victim to a massive exchange of fire. Along with the almost 9,000 British and German seamen who perished, they were left to the fate of the ocean. This museum displays themed exhibitions and this guide adds audio featuring stories from the battle.Read moreCollapse.
