country: US.
description: All the fruit is from Wahluke Slope vineyard, with 2% Viognier. Aged for 17 months in French oak, this is a big step up from the 2005. The fruit scents are bold and pure, showing lush berry notes and leading gracefully into a darker mix of smoke, coffee grounds, tobacco and licorice. There is a lot of barrel influence, but the fruit is so good that it can take it. This is a wine to drink young and savor..
