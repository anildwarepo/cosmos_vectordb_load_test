But recently it won't load anything at all even though my internet connection is totally fine. It will just load the course on main screen once after being opened. After doing anything else that makes the screen reload, nothing come up while it still shows it is loading. Clearing the cache or data does not fix this. This app used to be so great. You could learn almost anything. People were able to make courses on languages that otherwise wouldn't get much exposure. I loved memrise!

You could learn almost anything. People were able to make courses on languages that otherwise wouldn't get much exposure. I loved memrise! The website I was learning Korean on even had a memrise set to go along with the lessons. I learned a lot. But now? After the ""big new updates"", it's not the same app at all. The amount of languages is no where NEAR how many there were before. Everything is paywalled. I am very upset. Bring the old memrise back. This app is perfect for leaening languages, especially when you got a short moment of time. So far I've learned 3 languages over it and I sure will continue.

So far I've learned 3 languages over it and I sure will continue. Though it's sad that user made courses are only available on pc, I can remember that there was a search option to find other courses when I started. Also, once you get used to the latest design changes they put out a new one... This is helping me step up my game so much!

Before I had so much trouble learning vocabulary, and I'd have to go through countless pages to even remember 5 words. Memrise makes it so easy to just see the word, learn it and never forget it. Now I know lots and lots of vocabulary and I couldn't be happier with my progress. Seriously one of the best things I could do to quickly progress in my language studies is install this app. You won't regret it!.
