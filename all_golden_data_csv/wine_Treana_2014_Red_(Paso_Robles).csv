country: US.
description: Redolent with ripeness and lavish caramel-vanilla tones throughout, this blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Syrah is very much an Austin Hope wine, alluring in aromas of lush blackcurrant, kirsch and melted chocolate on the nose. The palate is rich with espresso, German chocolate cake and cr√®me de cassis, surrounded by flavors of molasses, brown sugar, coffee candy and even Scotch on the finish..
