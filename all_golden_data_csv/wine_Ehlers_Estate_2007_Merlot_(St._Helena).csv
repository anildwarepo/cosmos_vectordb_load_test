description: A spectacular Merlot that could help resurrect this variety's reputation. It's as complex as anything from Napa, but is softer and more accessible than a Cabernet Sauvignon, which constitutes 8% of the blend. Shows ripe flavors of red cherry pie filling, raspberries and cola, almost like a Pinot Noir, except for the black currants that must come from the Cab, and of course the tannins, which are rich and fine. Simply gorgeous and compelling. nowâ€“2013..
