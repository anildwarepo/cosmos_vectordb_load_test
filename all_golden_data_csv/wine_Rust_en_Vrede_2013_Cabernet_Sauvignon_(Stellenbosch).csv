wine_Rust_en_Vrede_2013_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Stellenbosch),"Unnamed: 0: 66238.
country: South Africa.
description: This is a ripe and dense yet well-balanced wine, offering forward aromas of boysenberry and deep, juicy red plum that are accented by notes of cocoa nib, roasted espresso and char. The palate boasts a plush texture, like crushed velvet, with gripping but not overly firm tannins and concentrated fruit flavors. Notes of licorice and earthy tobacco grace the long finish. Approachable now, but should evolve well through 2021..
