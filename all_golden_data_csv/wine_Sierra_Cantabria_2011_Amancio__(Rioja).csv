country: Spain.
description: This gorgeously crafted, full-bodied Tempranillo is a modern beauty. Marzipan, wood grain, baking spice and black-fruit aromas make for a spectacular bouquet, while a ripped, strapping palate is raring to go. Flavors of blackened toast, fine wood, black plum and blackberry finish with gusto and notes of licorice, baking spices and cracked black peppercorn linger on the finish. Hold until 2017, then drink through 2026..
