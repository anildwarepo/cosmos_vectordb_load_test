country: US.
description: A stunner of a rosé, this wine's pale pink hue does little to indicate its action-packed reality. Nectarine, wet stone, and bubble gum occupy the aroma profile, but the flavors are what set it off. Ruby red grapefruit, strawberry shortcake, and a slight lemon chiffon element hammer home this beauty by Sta. Rita Hills-based superstar producer Kris Curran, formerly of both Sea Smoke and Foley. This is versatile enough to handle both seared scallops and grilled babyback pork ribs..
