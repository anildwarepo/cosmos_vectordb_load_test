country: US.
description: A tremendous Cabernet, showing the authority of its vineyard, high up in the Vaca Mountains. Dry and full-bodied, this wine is spectacularly rich in blackberries, cassis and minerals and is well oaked. What's most remarkable is the quality of the tannins. They're firm, yet soft and sweetly refined. A tremendous accomplishment, and should develop in the bottle for a decade. At this price, an outstanding value..
