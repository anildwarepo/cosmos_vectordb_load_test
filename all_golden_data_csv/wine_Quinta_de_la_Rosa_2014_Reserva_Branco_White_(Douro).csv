country: Portugal.
description: This is a ripe, wood aged wine that has great structure as well as ample fruit flavor. It has a touch of toastiness—50% is aged in oak—although it is sophisticated and subtle. Apple, fresh apricot and green plum flavors show through the still young texture. All native grapes—35% Viosinho, 35% Rabigato and other locals from the estate—are the same used for Port blends. To bring out the richer, more rounded side of this wine, wait until 2017 to enjoy..
