Description: Violent, strange saga spanning four continents and four generations. Araki's ideas are stretched increasingly thin, but there is still plenty of action and new concepts to sustain the interest of demanding Shounen Jump readers. Each part of Jojo can be read more or less independently, and has its own atmosphere and storytelling/art style..
