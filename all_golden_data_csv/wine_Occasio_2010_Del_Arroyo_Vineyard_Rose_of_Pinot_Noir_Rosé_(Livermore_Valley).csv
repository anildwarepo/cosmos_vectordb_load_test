country: US.
description: Occasio continues to build its case for being a winery to watch out of the Livermore Valley, releasing this lively, raspberry and honeycomb rosé made from Pinot Noir grapes out of its Del Arroyo Vineyard. The Pommard clone fruit was cold soaked in stainless steel, then pressed from the skins and racked again into stainless steel. A rosé with some meat on its bones, it's way more than an aperitif and will stand strongly aside a full range of summer foods..
