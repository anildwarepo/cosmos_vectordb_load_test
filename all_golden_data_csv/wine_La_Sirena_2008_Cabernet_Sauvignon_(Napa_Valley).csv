wine_La_Sirena_2008_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Napa_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 88863.
country: US.
description: You will want to age this Cabernetâ€”8 or 10 years of development is the only way to allow the hard tannins to begin to melt away, allowing the fabulous core of blackberries, currants and dark chocolate to emerge. It's hard to exaggerate the wine's depth; it's so elegantly pure, concentrated and focused. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2018, and it could still be providing pleasure 20 years from now..
