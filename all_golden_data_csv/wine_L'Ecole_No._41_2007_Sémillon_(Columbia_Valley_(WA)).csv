country: US.
description: This Sémillon is quite dry, with an unusual mouthfeel that is a bit like chewing on beeswax, honeycomb without the sweetness of honey. It's a beautifully scented wine with a beguiling mix of floral and spice, suggestions of cinnamon, baking spice and body powder. Following on the palate are firm yet supple flavors of melon, pear and hints of baked apple, gliding into a smooth and satisfying finish, which resonates with hints of buttered toast..
