country: US.
description: Just beautiful to drink now, despite grippy tannins that give the ripe fruit an astringent mouthfeel. Based on Cabernet Franc, the wine's flavors are simply delicious, offering waves of cherries, blueberries, plums and currants. Plenty of new oak adds toasty vanilla. Those tannins suggest pairing this wine with rich foods, such as lamb, but you don't want to smother the delicacy underneath a rustic stew. Drink soon, before it loses freshness..
