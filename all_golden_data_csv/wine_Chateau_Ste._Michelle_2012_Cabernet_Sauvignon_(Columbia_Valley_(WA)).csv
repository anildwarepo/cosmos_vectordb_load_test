country: US.
description: CSM's mainstream Cabernet Sauvignon now carries a “100% vinifera rootstock” designation—surely a first for any American winery. It displays more structure than some of the other, similarly priced offerings from the Northwest's largest winery group. With good focus and length, its mix of plum and berry fruit, nicely set in a frame of toast, coffee and charred wood, makes it a surefire, all-purpose, medium-bodied red..
