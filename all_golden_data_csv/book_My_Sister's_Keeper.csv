Description: Though separated from her lover, a Scotland Yard man, Gillian Adams hasn't lost her sleuthing skills. Sexism has reared its ugly head in attacks on the Feminist (""Eff Yours"") Union at the University of the Pacific Northwest in Vancouver, and a woman is found dead on campus. Adroitly plotted and filled with intrigue, ""My Sister's Keeper"" solves the crimes but leaves open the mystery of Gillian, who is poised between her career as head of history department and her romance in England..
