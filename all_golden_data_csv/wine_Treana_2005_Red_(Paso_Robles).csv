country: US.
description: Quietly, under the radar, Treana's red blend is turning into an interesting and exciting wine over every vintage. The '05, a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, shows Paso Robles terroir at its best. The wine is soft, but no softer than a cult Napa Cab, and enormously rich in currant, licorice, chocolate, smoky oak and cinnamon spice flavors that are just delicious. Best now and for a few years..
