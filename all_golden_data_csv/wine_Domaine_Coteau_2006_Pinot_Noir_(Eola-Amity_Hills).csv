country: US.
description: From the first whiff—laden with tangy notes of herb, leaf and spicy cranberry fruit—this announces itself as classic Oregon Pinot Noir. At 14+% it's ripe enough to build a core of sweet cherry fruit; but it is not shy about expressing the herbal side of the grape, and does so to good effect. It's a vivacious, expressive wine that offers a rich range of flavors, well beyond the basic fruit and barrel approach of too many wineries..
