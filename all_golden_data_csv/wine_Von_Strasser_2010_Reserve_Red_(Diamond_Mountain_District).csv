wine_Von_Strasser_2010_Reserve_Red_(Diamond_Mountain_District),"Unnamed: 0: 107779.
country: US.
description: This is a 40-40 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, with the balance consisting of Merlot. It's a barrel selection of the winery's best lots, from its various vineyards, and has been aged in 100% new French oak. Yet it's not oaky at all, with the wood bringing only additional sweet, smoky richness to the red currants, cherries, dark chocolate and spices. This is a superb wine, delicious right out of the bottle, but it should develop and, depending on your tastes, improve over the next 20 years..
