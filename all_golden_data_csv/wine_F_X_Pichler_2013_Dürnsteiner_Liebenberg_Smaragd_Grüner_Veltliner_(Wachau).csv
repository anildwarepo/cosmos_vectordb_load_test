country: Austria.
description: A delightful citrus scent intrigues, suggesting yuzu or mandarin. The palate is richer and introduces notions of earth and that pithy, phenolic edge of serious Grüner Veltliner. The initial citrus on the nose returns with redoubled force on the streamlined, fresh and still tightly closed palate. Give this time to unwind, so that the fruit can fully express itself. The deliciously green- and orange-tinged finish promises everything. Drink from 2017..
