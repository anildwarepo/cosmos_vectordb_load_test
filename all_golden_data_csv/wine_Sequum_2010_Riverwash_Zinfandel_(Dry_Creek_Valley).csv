country: US.
description: The word “briary” is hard to define. In Zinfandel, it suggests wild berries, ripe under the summer sun, but also the peppery weeds that grow nearby, many of them succulent herbs with bracing medicinal qualities. Dry Creek Zins are famous for these notes, and this is a classic Dry Creek Zin. The alcohol is quite high, but not out of balance, and the overall impression is the essence of Sonoma old-vine Zinfandel..
