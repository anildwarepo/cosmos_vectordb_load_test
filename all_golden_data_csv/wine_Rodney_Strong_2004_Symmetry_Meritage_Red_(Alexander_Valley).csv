country: US.
description: Strong's Symmetry almost qualifies as a Cabernet Sauvignon, with 71% of that variety, and the rest consisting of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. The Meritage labeling identifies it as their supreme bottling of a Bordeaux-style wine. Easily the best Symmetry ever, it is a great wine. Dry and somewhat astringent in tannins, it has an impressively deep core of blackberries and currants, with an array of sweet herbs, chocolate and tobacco. It's delicious now, and should slowly develop bottle complexities over the next 10 years..
