country: South Africa.
description: A gorgeous, single-vineyard Chenin Blanc that shows great complexity and balance. The bouquet is initially seductive and oaky, but it subsides with time to integrate with the ripe melon, mango and yellow peach scents. Developed and slightly honeyed, the palate is lush and round. Almond, honeysuckle and soft sweet spice flavors stay through the long close. Tasty now, but should age nicely through 2015..
