Description: FBI Agent Pierce Quincy is haunted by his daughter's death in a drunk- driving accident. Pierce knew about his daughter's problem with alcohol, and about her loneliness. And so, he is sure, did the man who killed her. Rainie Conner is an ex-cop with a past overshadowed by violence. She was once involved with Pierce in a harrowing case that brought them together personally and professionally. Then he came to her rescue. Now it is time for her to help him. This killer is different. He has an insatiable hunger for revenge - and for fear. He isn't satisfied with taking his victims' lives, he wants to get inside their minds and strip them of every defence. And his target is Quincy's only surviving daughter. Rainie believes that only way to stop him is to put herself directly into the killer's murderous path and become - the next accident..
