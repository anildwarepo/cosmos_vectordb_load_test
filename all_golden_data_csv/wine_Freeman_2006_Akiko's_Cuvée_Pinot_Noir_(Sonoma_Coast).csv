country: US.
description: Just delicious, a nine-vineyard blend from some of the cooler pockets of this sprawling appellation. But don't let the tasty succulence mask its considerable complexity. Light in color, silky and almost weightless in the mouth, it delivers a massive blast of acid-tinged flavors. Ripe, sweet raspberries, cherry pulp, red licorice, sweet pomegranate marmalade, root beer, cloves, smoky oak, a final dusting of crushed black peppercorn, it just goes on and on. Highly recommended despite the hefty price..
