country: US.
description: While the Finger Lakes region is better known for Riesling, this gorgeously composed single-vineyard Cabernet Franc sets a benchmark for American red wine. The nose is delicately perfumed of violet, lavender and autumn leaves. On the palate, swirls of luscious black fruit juxtapose layers of granite and stone. Briskly balanced, yet endlessly persistent on the finish, it's a standout bottling that's well worth seeking out..
