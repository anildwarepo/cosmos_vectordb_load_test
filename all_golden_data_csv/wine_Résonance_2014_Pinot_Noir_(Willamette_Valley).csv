wine_Résonance_2014_Pinot_Noir_(Willamette_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 86772.
country: US.
description: This is the second release this year from Maison Louis Jadot's Oregon project—both wines are labeled Résonance, but this is the Willamette Valley cuvée, not the Résonance vineyard bottling. Some estate fruit is included, and it is a subtle and detailed wine, with pretty mulberry and pie-cherry fruit. Thirteen months in 20% new French oak adds light mocha highlights, and it is as smooth and refined as one might expect from master winemaker Jacques Lardière..
