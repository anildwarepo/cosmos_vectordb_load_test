country: US.
description: Baer's Arctos blend is about three fifths Cabernet Sauvignon, and here the grape shows less fat, and more structure than in the previous vintage. It's a better wine, sleek and yet fruity, with a pleasing mix of blackberry and cassis. The tannins are forceful, herbal, and sturdy, giving the finish a firm spine. The grace notes of clove and coffee and loam continue to add interest as the wine lingers through a dense finish..
