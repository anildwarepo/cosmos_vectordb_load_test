country: US.
description: Les Collines is one of the most exciting Syrah vineyards in the state and this wine, which all comes from Block 30 and saw only neutral barrels, expresses this site exquisitely. It opens with aromas of violets, rubbed herb, smoked meat and purple fruit. The palate brings a mesmerizing sense of purity, with mouth-coating seamless fruit and savory flavors. It drinks well on its own but is really designed for the dinner table..
