description: Lifted peach and wilting petals of Damask rose unite in the perfumed, supremely aromatic nose of this wine. The palate continues with rosewater notes of Turkish Delight and candied peach. Honeyed and rich, the sweet palate is concentrated but guided by lemony freshness. Overwhelming with perfume and concentration, this decadent wine needs either a perfumed, peachy dessert or a salty blue cheese to match those crashing waves of full-blown flavor..
