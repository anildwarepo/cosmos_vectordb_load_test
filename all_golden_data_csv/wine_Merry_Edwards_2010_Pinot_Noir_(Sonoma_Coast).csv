description: Power vs. finesse. Which wins out? It's pretty much a draw in this blend of various sites throughout the sprawling Sonoma Coast appellation. It shows the acidity and dryness of the coast, as well as the long hangtime richness of the vintage, with spicy raspberry and cherry flavors liberally oaked. A gorgeous wine, and a bargain given that it's the least expensive of the winery's 2010 Pinots. Drink nowâ€“2014..
