wine_Meinklang_2015_Graupert_Pinot_Gris_(Burgenland),"Unnamed: 0: 44326.
country: Austria.
description: There is a wonderfully aromatic element of something floral and tropical on the nose of this unusual Pinot Gris. The fruit expression is very ripe, reminiscent of melon and juicy pear, highlighted with pineapple and fresh lemon, but there also is ample zesty freshness for balance. If you thought you had tasted all that Pinot Gris has to offer, taste this one, which was created from unpruned vines left to their own devices and bearing deliciously few clusters of delicious fruit..
