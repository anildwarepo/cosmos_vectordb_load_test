wine_Jean_Biecher_&_Fils_2016_Sommerberg_Grand_Cru_Riesling_(Alsace),"Unnamed: 0: 22361.
country: France.
description: A subdued nose gives glints of earthy smoke and citrus zest. It is on the palate that soaring notes of ripe Amalfi lemon tangerines appear. This is ripeness expressed within a taut firm frame of acidic bright structure. The palate is concentrated and linear, the finish is dry and lasting. The citrus aromas gain something of apple towards the finish. Wonderfully fresh. Lovely now but sure to develop. Drink 2017–2035..
