country: Austria.
description: The almost luminous pink hue promises exuberance: the wine delivers a plethora of fruit notes—spicy elderberries, luscious strawberries and juicy red cherries all take turns to dazzle. Is this your typical rosé? Certainly not—it's more of an ultralight red that needs chilling. But it certainly delivers sophisticated yet fun drinking. Simply abandon yourself to its joyful flavors and celebrate summer!.
