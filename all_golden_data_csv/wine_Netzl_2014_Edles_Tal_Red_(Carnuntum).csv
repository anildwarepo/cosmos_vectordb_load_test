country: Austria.
description: There is a dark brooding smell of black cherry and dark fruit of the forest, all held together with the chocolate tinge of smoky oak. The body is more fresh faced and lets the aromatic expressive fruit speak: It is juicy and vibrant, with a lovely pepperiness. The tannins are velvety and dense, but there is mellow flow and ample aromatic freshness. This strikes a good balance between sumptuous winemaking and pure fruit..
