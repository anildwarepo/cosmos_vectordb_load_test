description: Some will critique this Pinot as too big and bold, but it defines the ripe, exuberant California style. It's fabulously rich in berry fruit, mocha and spice flavors. Nothing shy about it, and not particularly subtle in its appeal, but it does show meticulous vineyard care and terroir. Its future evolution is unclear, but this delicious Pinot Noir is a natural partner to full-bodied lamb and beef dishes..
