country: US.
description: Seductively smooth and intriguingly aromatic, this blend of several knock-out vineyards along Westside Road—Allen, Bacigalupi, Bucher, Rochioli Riverblock and Williams Selyem Estate—is instantly delicious, sharing a concentration of cherry, strawberry and citrus that perfectly captures the essence of the fruit, accented by a tease of black tea. An earthy minerality wraps around dry, polished tannins, with a streak of just-right acidity, giving it a realm of juiciness and flavorful sophistication. Enjoy through 2023..
