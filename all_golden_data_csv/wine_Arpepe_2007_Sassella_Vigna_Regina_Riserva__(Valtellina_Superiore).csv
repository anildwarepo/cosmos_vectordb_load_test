description: This radiant, fragrant Nebbiolo opens with a potpourri of scents including aromatic herb, leather, cedar, pressed rose petal and dark spice. The luminous, subtle palate is loaded with finesse, delivering juicy red cherry, cinnamon, star anise, white pepper and pipe tobacco. It's impeccably balanced, with noble tannins and bright acidity.
