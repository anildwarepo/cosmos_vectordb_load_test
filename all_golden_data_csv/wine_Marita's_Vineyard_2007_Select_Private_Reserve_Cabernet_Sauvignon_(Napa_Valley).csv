country: US.
description: This extraordinary winery continues to produce some of Napa's most distinguished Cabernets. The vineyard is in the cool-climate appellation of Coombsville, which accounts for its superb structure of acids and tannins. Perfectly ripe black-currant flavors meld into toasty new-oak tones. At the age of more than six years, the wine is starting to mellow, but is only hinting at the drama to come. It has enough splendor to glidepath through the decades..
