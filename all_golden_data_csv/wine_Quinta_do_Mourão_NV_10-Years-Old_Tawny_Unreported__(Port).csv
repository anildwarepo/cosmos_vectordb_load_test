country: Portugal.
description: An old gold-colored wine, this presents a dry, more aged view of 10-Year-Old tawny than usual. The result is a strong sense of spirit without losing the old wood flavors and the reminder of fruitiness. It's balanced and delicious. The sons of founder Mário Braga now run the quinta and farms nearby producing both Port and dry red wines. This is a private blend for Schlossadler Imports in California..
