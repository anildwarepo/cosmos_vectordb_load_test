country: US.
description: This limited release (300 cases), first-ever Zin from Columbia Crest points to the rising prominence of this quintessentially Californian grape. In Washington's Wahluke Slope, Zin ripens well without turning into a Port-like substance. Tightly-defined raspberry, blackberry and plum fruits, scented with violets and juicy with fresh acid, take to the new oak aging well. It's a balanced mix of berry, barrel and crisp, palate-cleansing acid..
