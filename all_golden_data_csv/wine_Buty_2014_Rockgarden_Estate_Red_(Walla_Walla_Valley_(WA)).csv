wine_Buty_2014_Rockgarden_Estate_Red_(Walla_Walla_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 86635.
country: US.
description: Despite coming from the Rocks District, the appellation doesn't seem to truly reveal itself on this blend of 75% Mourvèdre, 20% Grenache and 5% Syrah. Light in color, the aromas are bright, with notes of raspberry compote, cranberry, raw meat and green herb. The palate brings well-balanced red-fruit flavors, with the oak seeming dialed way back. It doesn't quite stand up on its own but should shine at the dinner table..
