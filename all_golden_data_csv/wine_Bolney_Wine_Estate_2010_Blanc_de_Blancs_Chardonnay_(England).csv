country: England.
description: Lively, crisp apple notes on the nose immediately signal freshness. The palate follows with equally brisk green apple and citrus notes, mellowed fittingly with a very fine, soft and creamy mousse. This is lithe, dew-fresh and of great purity. It conjures up visions of clear brooks, green meadows and budding elderflower. The crisp green-apple notes echo long and make for a totally refreshing, brisk finish..
