First Page Reviews: Very  well made, I hope it will be enriched with more elements like restaurants and cafes. I thought I had visited all the museums of Barcelona.... but I had the nice surprise of finding a few more thanks to this app. Great to have all the prices and opening times and days in one place. Hopefully I'll never have the bad surprise of ending up in front of a closed museum. Found great tips for Museums My GF's parents came to visit Bcn so I recommended this app as they wanted to visit to La Casa Batlló and we did not have time to go with them. Thanks! Great Guide! Quite a helpful app for our visit to Barcelona! We didn't have mobile data on our phones so the offline availability was a plus..
