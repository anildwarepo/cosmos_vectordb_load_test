country: France.
description: Something floral and stony appears on the nose, along with a hint of smoke and something uncompromising and hard. The palate then packs a real punch: the wine hits you like a bullet of concentrated freshness and citric verve. This is bundled and effective, delivering a hit of ripened freshness with its lemon-zest dominated, dry tanginess. The finish has something juicy and luscious and is absolutely dry and clean. Totally lip-smacking. Drink now through 2027..
