country: France.
description: This small property with its own château lies within the lower portion of Vaudésir but is considered a Grand Cru in its own right. The wine—the flagship of the cooperative—is opulent, showing strong wood aging flavors that will soften with time. Ripe and generous with yellow fruit flavor, it also boasts a tight mineral acidity and crispness, making it a good candidate for cellaring. Drink from 2021..
