wine_DanCin_2012_Pas_de_Trois_Pinot_Noir_(Oregon),"Unnamed: 0: 11445.
country: US.
description: Grapes from three vineyards (estate, Hyland and Durant) and seven different clones are blended here, then aged for 14 months in 40% new French oak. At first sniff it's more steely than oaky, with chunky flavors of red fruits firmly underscored with highlights of earth and stem. There's a vein of black licorice also, and the wine leaves the impression that waiting until 2016–2017 will help bring out its best..
