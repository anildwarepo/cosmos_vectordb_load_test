country: South Africa.
description: A complex, kitchen-sink blend of 29% Chenin Blanc, 23% Roussanne, 11% Viognier, 11% Chardonnay, 10% Grenache Blanc, 5% Colombar, 5% Grenache Gris, 2% SÃ©millon, 2% Clairette and 1% Verdelho, there's a lot to be discovered in this wine. Melon, pear and sweet citrus lead the bouquet, with nuances of orange blossom and honeysuckle, while spicy flavors of baked apple, glazed canteloupe and lightly-mulled pear flood the palate. Round and forward, with a silky texture; give it time to open up now or hold another couple of years..
