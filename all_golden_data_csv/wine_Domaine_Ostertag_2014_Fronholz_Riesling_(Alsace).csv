description: The faintest hints of smoke, apricot and honey hit the nose, while the palate of this wine shows balmy apricot notes but is otherwise still closed. A quiet harmony of fruit and freshness, body and weight already tells us that this needs time to show its true colors. The wine is is promising and elegant, tart and gentle, fresh and soothing. Right now it glides arrow-like across the palate. Give this time: drink 2028–2030..
