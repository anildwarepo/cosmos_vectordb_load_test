wine_Trimbach_2015_Riesling_(Alsace),"Unnamed: 0: 16171.
country: France.
description: The faintest hint of zesty lemon appears on the nose. The dry palate is of a concentrated slenderness, showing intense notes of ripe lemon zest but hinting at richer notions of ripe pear and candied citron. There is real impact, guided by rapier-like freshness and utter precision. This has an almost cleansing quality but is nonetheless imbued with the fruitful generosity of 2015. Lovely now, but sure to develop. Drink now through 2027..
