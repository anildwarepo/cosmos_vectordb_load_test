country: US.
description: Consistent with previous releases, this Michel Rolland effort is a soft, silky, smoky wine that introduces itself with round cherry fruit and then charges ahead with layers of licorice, citrus, coffee and rock that enliven the finish. There is plenty of tart raspberry fruit to open, and the balancing acids to give the wine a tight core. It's a very polished and appealing balance of forward, approachable fruit married to more elegant, ageworthy tannins and acids..
