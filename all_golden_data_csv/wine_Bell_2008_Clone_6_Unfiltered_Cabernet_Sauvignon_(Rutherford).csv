country: US.
description: Made from 100% Cabernet grown in the Beckstoffer Georges III Vineyard, and aged in mostly new French and American oak, its tannins are tough as nails. Yet there's a vast core of blackberry and black cherry fruit that's just yearning to break out. With modest alcohol (the official reading is a mere 13.2% by volume), it's a natural choice for the cellar. It should begin to blossom by 2016 and continue to develop beyond 2020..
