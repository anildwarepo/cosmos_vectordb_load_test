country: US.
description: Farmed under the winery's Nellaserra greenhouse system, this is an atypical blend for northern Michigan: 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Nebbiolo, 20% Merlot and 15% Syrah. This is a seemless m√©lange of spiced currant, cranberry and red plum, accented by warm spices and crushed violets. The round, medium-to full-bodied palate follows suit, with streaks of crushed stone giving levity all the way through to the lingering toasted-spice finish..
