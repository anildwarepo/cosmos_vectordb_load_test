country: US.
description: Named after the New York City neighborhood where owner Jack Messina's ancestors first immigrated, this blend of 55% Syrah, 27% Grenache, 17% Mourvèdre and a half-percent each of Viognier and Roussanne hits the nose with notes of violet, mocha, black cherry, slate and coffee. The tannins are mouthcoating, yet allow tart flavors of cherry and boysenberry to pass through, boosted by smoke and licorice on the edges. Drink from 2018..
