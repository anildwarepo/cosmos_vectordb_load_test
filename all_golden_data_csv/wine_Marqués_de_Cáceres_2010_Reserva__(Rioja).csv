country: Spain.
description: Riojas of this quality and price are not a dime a dozen. This ripe, delicious wine shows all the virtues of a great vintage. Earthy, roasted berry aromas are pure, ripe and magnetic. This feels full, tannic and strapping, while flavors of cassis, blackberry and chocolate are supported by generous but appropriate oak. Mocha, espresso and black-fruit residuals grace a fine finish. Drink through 2022..
