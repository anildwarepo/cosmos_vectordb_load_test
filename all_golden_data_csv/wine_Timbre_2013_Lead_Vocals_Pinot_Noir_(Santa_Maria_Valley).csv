country: US.
description: Josh Klapper made six barrels of this wine from coveted old vines at Bien Nacido Vineyard. The result is an exciting, focused expression of minerality, with wet cement prominent on the nose alongside black cherry, alpine strawberry and a touch of vanilla dust. Light and lithe in mouthfeel yet still packed with tons of flavor, the old vines unleash cranberry, pomegranate, orange rind, thyme, bay leaf and eucalyptus flavors..
