country: US.
description: The vineyard sources for this Bordeaux-style blend—Champoux, Ciel du Cheval, Weinbau and Dineen—are impeccable, and represent four of the best AVAs in Washington. It's almost exactly half and half Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, and smells like beautifully ripe blackberries, boysenberries and cassis. It sets up in the mouth firm and textural, and adds layers of chocolate and baking spices as it winds through the finish. Not a soft wine, but more open and accessible than most vintages of Soos Creek..
