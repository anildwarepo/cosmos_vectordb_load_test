wine_Château_Fonbadet_2014__Pauillac,"Unnamed: 0: 109927.
country: France.
description: This Peyronie family cru bourgeois estate is one of the rare properties in Pauillac that is not a classified growth. That alone makes it a good value. The wine comes from vines close to Pichon Baron in the south of the appellation. This juicy black-currant flavored wine is still very young, full of its tannins and dark character. With its structure and acidity, the wine will age well. Drink from 2022..
