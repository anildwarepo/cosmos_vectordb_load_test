country: Italy.
description: Underbrush, wild berry, dark culinary spice, chopped herb and tilled earth are just some of the aromas you'll discover on this gorgeous wine. Impeccably balanced and loaded with finesse, the palate delivers wild raspberry, red cherry, clove, ground white pepper and licorice while radiant acidity and youthfully austere noble tannins provide structure. It already boasts impressive depth but it still needs to fully develop. A gorgeous wine. Drink 2025–2043..
