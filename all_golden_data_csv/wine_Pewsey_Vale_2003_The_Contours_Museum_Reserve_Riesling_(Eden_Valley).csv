country: Australia.
description: It's a rare treat when a winery bottle-ages a wine for you, but that's exactly what's happened here. The result is a top-notch dry Aussie Riesling that's just entering its plateau of maturity, where it should stay for another 5â€“10 years. Slightly honeyed notes soften the intense scents of crushed stones, then pick up hints of tangerine on the palate. Replacing the briskness of youth is a soft, lingering finish..
