wine_Simonsig_2011_Merindol_Syrah_(Stellenbosch),"Unnamed: 0: 55856.
country: South Africa.
description: This wine is immediately attractive and seductive, with forward floral notes of crushed iris and violet that are supported by a decadent ripe-fruit core of black raspberry, wild cherry and boysenberry. Woody tones of toasted coconut and vanilla add richness to the dense, fully structured palate, while hints of black pepper and cocoa nib blossom on the finish. Delicious now, but should age well through 2018..
