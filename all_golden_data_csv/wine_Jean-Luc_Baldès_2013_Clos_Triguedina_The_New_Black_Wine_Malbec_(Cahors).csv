country: France.
description: Created as an homage to the traditional powerful “black wines” that set the reputation of Cahors in Medieval times, this wine follows the old practice of heating the grape must before fermentation. The result is enormous concentration, seriously tannic ripe black fruit and considerable acidity. These are all elements that demand aging, and even at four years old this wine is just starting out. Drink from 2021 at the earliest..
