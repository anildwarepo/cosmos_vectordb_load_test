wine_Domaine_Zind-Humbrecht_2007_Wintzheim_Gewurztraminer_(Alsace),"Unnamed: 0: 44364.
country: France.
description: Profound enough for serious contemplation but with enough broad fruit appeal to serve to a crowd. There's loads of upfront Asian spice and lychee, afloat on a luxurious, sensually textured palate. Notes of geranium and macadamia nuts keep the taste buds entertained and carry over to the lingering finish. The noticeable residual sugar suggests pairing with something slightly sweet, like Tilapia in a mango salsa. Drink now to 2011..
