wine_R.L._Buller_&_Son_NV_Calliope_Rare_Muscat_(Rutherglen),"Unnamed: 0: 67106.
country: Australia.
description: This is dark, almost black in color at the center, with greening evident at the rim. Syrupy, intense aromas of coffee and dark chocolate make an immediate impact on the nose, followed by syrupy, intense flavors of coffee and molasses. There's mind-boggling concentration here, but just enough acidity to provide a sense of balance. Still, it's hard to imagine drinking more than a couple of ounces of this at a time..
