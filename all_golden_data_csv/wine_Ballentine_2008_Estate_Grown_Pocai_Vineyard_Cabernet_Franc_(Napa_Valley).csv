country: US.
description: The Pocai Vineyard is a very interesting one, growing Chenin Blanc, Merlot, Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, and the wines are always worth looking into. This Cabernet Franc, at four years of age, is mellowing, with the tannins turning gentle and the flavors becoming delicious and dramatic. Particularly bright in red cherries, it's a beautiful wine for drinking over the next year or two..
