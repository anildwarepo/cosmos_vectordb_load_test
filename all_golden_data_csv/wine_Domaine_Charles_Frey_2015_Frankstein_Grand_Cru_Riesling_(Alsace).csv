country: France.
description: A wonderfully savory touch of fragrant wild thyme precedes the tangerine peel notes on the nose of this promising and aromatically scented wine. The palate comes through with tangy zesty tangerine and bright fresh lemon. This is streamlined and taut, muscular but svelte. This just fills palate and mind with its fizzing, vibrant citrus notes that shine on the absolutely dry concentrated palate. Lots of refreshment and excitement here. Drink 2017–2030..
