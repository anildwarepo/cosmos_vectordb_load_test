country: US.
description: Cedarville remains an estate producer to follow in the Foothills, melding a well-farmed site with clean, clear winemaking in the cellar. Grown on decomposed granite hillsides, this Syrah has 4% Viognier, just the right touch to bring out the best aromatics, highlighted by sage. Dark, earthy and leathery, this wine is holding onto its tannin and oak, but given time to rest in the cellar 5â€“7 years, it'll scream to be served with cassoulet..
