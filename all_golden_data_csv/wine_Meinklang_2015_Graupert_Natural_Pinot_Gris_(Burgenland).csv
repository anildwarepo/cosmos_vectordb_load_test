country: Austria.
description: Gorgeously lifted rich notes of orange zest fill the nose of this beautiful “orange” wine. Fermented on skins, it has all the elegance of white wine, combined with the tannic structure and backbone of red. Made from pink Pinot Gris grapes, this lends itself beautifully to this treatment and leaves us with an intriguing, concentrated, fresh and whistle-clean wine of great expression. Savor its salty orange-scented length..
