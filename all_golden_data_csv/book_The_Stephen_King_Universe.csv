Description: ""I am coming to understand that Roland's world actually contains all the others of my making"" --Stephen King With those words, from The Dark Tower: IV Wizard and Glass, the world's most popular writer confirmed a suspicion long held by readers--that the myriad worlds and universes King has created are, in reality, one world, one universe. Here, for the first time ever is the guide to that universe, a thrilling road map and informative tour for new readers and diehard fans alike. The Stephen King Universe is the very first examination of all of King's fiction and the way in which its plots and characters, conflicts, and themes, intertwine. This definitive reference work examines his novels and short stories, as well as the motion pictures, miniseries, and teleplays that King has written. The authors spent three years discovering and tying together the threads that exist in King's fiction. Their insightful results will entertain and surprise readers new and old. Once you have read The Stephen King Universe, you will never read Stephen King the same way again.
