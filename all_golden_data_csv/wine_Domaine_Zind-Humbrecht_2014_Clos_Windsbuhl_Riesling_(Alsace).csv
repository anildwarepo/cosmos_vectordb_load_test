country: France.
description: Appetizing notes of ripe Cox Orange Pippin apples, both in their fresh, crunchy state and in a more mellow baked version, characterize the flavors of this wine, with overtones of strawberry and sun-warmed stone. The juicy palate is concentrated and incredibly mouthwatering, with generous ripeness pitched against pure, zesty freshness. It offers concentration, liveliness and purity in one amazing package. Drink now until 2030 at least..
