Description: L.A. Wambaugh-style. A world of cops on the rocks with a twist of murder. A cheap hooker named Missy Moonbeam takes a fatal dive from the roof of a sleazy hotel. But what's a Caltech phone number doing in her trick book? And how does that connect to a dead private eye and a useless credit card? And what does all that have to do with a Whisky-class Russian sub and the Nobel Prize? Join Joseph Wambaugh's ravaged cops of Rampart Station as they follow a trail of corruption from the world of pimps and crazies to the think-tank labs of the country's top chemistry wizards--where genius and greed mix to create an award-winning case of murder. ""A page-turner . . . This is a must-read for Wambaugh fans.""--USA Today.
