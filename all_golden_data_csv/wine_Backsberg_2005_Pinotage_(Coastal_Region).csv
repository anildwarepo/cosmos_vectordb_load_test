wine_Backsberg_2005_Pinotage_(Coastal_Region),"Unnamed: 0: 3300.
country: South Africa.
description: The wines of Backsberg have a distinctive, artistic quality to them that makes them ideal for collectors and drinkers who seek wines with style. This Pinotage has those qualities, with its layers of cinnamon and deep berry on the nose and smooth, integrated berry and smoke flavors. This is a real Pinotage so expect the rubbery smoke that goes along with itâ€”but it's also elegant, offering structure and complexity with a gentle touch..
