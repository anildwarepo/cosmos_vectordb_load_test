country: US.
description: These are in fact the original Pinot Noir vines planted in the Willamette Valley, back in the mid-1960s. An explosion of sensory detail quickly opens up the wine, with pollen, sandalwood, sassafras and coffee grounds. Those flavors wrap around blackberry, licorice and cola, continuing to expand and explore the far reaches of the palate. Phylloxera may soon eliminate these vines, so don't wait to acquire a bit of history in a bottle..
