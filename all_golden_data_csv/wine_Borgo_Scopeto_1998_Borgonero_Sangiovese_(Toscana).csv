country: Italy.
description: This nuovo mondo Super Tuscan represents the first vintage of Borgo Scopeto under the management of Tenuta Caparzo, and it has a tremendous jammy, extracted quality to it, from the smooth, deep plum and blackberry nose to the soft, rich palate that exudes tons of black cherry fruit along with coffee and licorice. It's a mix of 60% Sangiovese, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Syrah, and everything is working in unison..
