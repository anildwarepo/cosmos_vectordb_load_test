country: Italy.
description: Aromas of exotic spice, iris, oak, coffee bean and wild berry come together on this structured, glossy red along with a note of grilled herb. The chewy palate boasts raspberry confiture, red cherry, espresso, dark chocolate, orange peel and tobacco while tightly knit, fine-grained tannins provide the framework. A licorice note closes the lingering finish. It's youthfully assertive and needs to fully develop. Drink 2020–2030..
