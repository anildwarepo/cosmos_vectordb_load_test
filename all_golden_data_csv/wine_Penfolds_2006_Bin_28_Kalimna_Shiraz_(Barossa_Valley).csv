description: Named for the famous Shiraz-growing district at the north end of the Barossa Valley, Penfolds' Kalimna Shiraz is in fact a multiregional South Australian blend that aims to recreate the Kalimna style. It succeeds admirably, albeit without the intensity and complexity that marks the best Barossan Shirazes, combining raspberries with touches of plum and prune before turning chocolaty on the finish. Drink nowâ€“2015..
