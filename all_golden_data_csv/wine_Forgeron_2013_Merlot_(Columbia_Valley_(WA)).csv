country: US.
description: This combines Merlot from Minnick Hills and Birch Creek vineyards in the Walla Walla Valley and Candy Mountain in the larger Columbia Valley with smaller amounts of Malbec from StoneTree and Petit Verdot from Dionysus. It's generous in aroma, with with plentiful coffee, raspberry, bittersweet chocolate, flower and graphite notes. The palate displays a lot of elegance, with tart acidity providing support. It's a very pretty expression of the variety that should show especially well at the dinner table..
