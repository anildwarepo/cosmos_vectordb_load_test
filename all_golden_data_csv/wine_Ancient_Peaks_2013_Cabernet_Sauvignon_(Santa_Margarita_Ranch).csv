country: US.
description: Black pepper, black plum and blueberry show on the nose of this bottling from the nearly 900-acre vineyard atop Cuesta Grade, where it enjoys essentially its own dedicated appellation. A very full mouthfeel delivers blueberry and blackberry-paste flavors along with pencil lead, black coffee and bitter espresso. Still a tad firm in structure, this should age well and open even further in the years to come..
