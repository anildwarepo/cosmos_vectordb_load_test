country: US.
description: Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot make up nearly equal parts of this blend, with the balance Cabernet Franc (9%). Coming from a who's who of vineyards that includes Bacchus, Red Willow, Klipsun and Boushey, it offers nuanced, supremely well balanced aromas of spice, dried herb, raspberry and blackberry. The palate delivers on all of this promise with succulent yet still reserved red and black fruit flavors that show purity, focus and impeccable balance that kicks it up a notch..
