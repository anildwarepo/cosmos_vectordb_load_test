country: Chile.
description: In the three vintages we've tasted this blend of Cabernet Franc, Cab Sauvignon and Carmen√®re, it has never slipped below 90 points. This 2005 version is the best yet; it has fine oak up front, with fresh berry aromas lurking below. The palate is sly, sexy and whole, with flavors of plum, cassis and leather. Secure on the finish, and overall there are no faults to be found. Drink now or hold for another couple of years..
