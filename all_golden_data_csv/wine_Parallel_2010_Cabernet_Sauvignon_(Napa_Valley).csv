wine_Parallel_2010_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Napa_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 29816.
country: US.
description: This is a tight, dry, tannic wine, showing all the hallmarks of ageabiity. Winemaker Philippe Melka has done a good job of blending fruit from Yountville, Atlas Peak and St. Helena to produce a seamlessly integrated Cabernet. The mouthfeel is soft, yet with fierce tannins that frame superb blackberry, cocoa, herb, mineral and cedar flavors. This continues a string of successful Cabernets that have been modestly priced, by Napa standards. Hold until 2018, at the very least..
