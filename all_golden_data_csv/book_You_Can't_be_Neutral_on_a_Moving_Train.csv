Description: “An inspiring autobiography . . . in the tradition of Martin Luther King’s ‘Letter from a Birmingham Jail.’ ” —Maureen Corrigan, Fresh Air, National Public Radio Beacon Press is proud to publish a new edition of the classic memoir by one of our most lively, influential, and engaged teachers and activists. Howard Zinn, author of A People’s History of the United States, tells his personal stories about more than thirty years of fighting for social change, from teaching at Spelman College to recent protests against war. A former bombardier in WWII, Zinn emerged in the civil rights movement as a powerful voice for justice. Although he’s a fierce critic, he gives us reason to hope that by learning from history and engaging politically, we can make a difference in the world. “A teacher who committed his politically engaged life to the belief that love is a command to action.” —Colman McCarthy, The Washington Post “A powerful, politically electric book from one of the most engaging social critics in the nation.” —Jonathan Kozol “Zinn explains his involvement in the struggles for civil rights, against war and in support of organized labor. . . . These are lively tales.” —The New York Times Book Review Howard Zinn, author of A People’s History of the United States and Three Strikes, lives near Boston..
