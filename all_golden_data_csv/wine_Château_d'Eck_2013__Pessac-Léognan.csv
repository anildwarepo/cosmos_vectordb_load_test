wine_Château_d'Eck_2013__Pessac-Léognan,"Unnamed: 0: 80288.
country: France.
description: This wine is firm and concentrated, with serious amounts of wood. Luckily the fruit is dense enough to show the potential of the wine, with plenty of acidity, black-currant flavors and freshness at the end. From the freeway, this chateau looks like a movie set and until recently there was nothing behind a grand medieval facade. Frédéric Gonet bought it in 1999 and new vineyards and château renovations began. The first red wine was released in 2012..
