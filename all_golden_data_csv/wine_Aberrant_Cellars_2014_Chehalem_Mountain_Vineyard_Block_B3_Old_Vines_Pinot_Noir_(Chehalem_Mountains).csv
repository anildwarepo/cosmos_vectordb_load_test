country: US.
description: From the last remaining block of a vineyard planted in 1968 by Oregon pioneer Dick Erath that's yielding less than 1.5 tons per acre, this is loaded with rose petal and cherry blossom aromas. Delicate and graceful, it offers subtle raspberry, blackberry and cherry fruit. The finish is exceptional, long and complex, with hints of coffee and caramel. Give this wine your full attention and enjoy how long it lingers..
