wine_Cave_de_Tain_2013_Noble_Rives__(Crozes-Hermitage),"Unnamed: 0: 128672.
country: France.
description: Cave de Tain remains a reference-point cave cooperative. The nose of this cuvée inspires shivers of anticipation, offering hints of bacon, cracked pepper, blueberries, roasted meat and black olives. It's only medium-bodied, but harmonious and nicely silky in texture. If there's a quibble, it's that the finish falls off a bit quickly, but this wine should still capably scratch nearly any Syrah itch..
