wine_Kuentz-Bas_2015_Kirchberg_de_Ribeauville_Grand_Cru_Muscat_(Alsace),"Unnamed: 0: 22364.
country: France.
description: Beautifully aromatic notes of ripe citrus peel rise from the glass—think tangerine and juicy clementine. These flavors become more zesty on the full-flavored, concentrated but linear palate. This is not overtly aromatic as Muscat would usually suggest but more concentrated, more serious, with an alluring citrus-scented core that promises beautiful development over the years. There is great balance, lasting length and beautiful poise. Drink 2017–2025..
