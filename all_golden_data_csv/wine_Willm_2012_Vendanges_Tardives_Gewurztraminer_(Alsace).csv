country: France.
description: Blood orange and peach snatch your senses at the very first whiff. The aromatics are disarming but no longer heady: this has matured into a sober pleasure that's full of peaches scented with passion fruit and barley sugar. The flavors swirl and soar, the luscious sweetness anchors them deftly. This is what a combination of time, fruit and a sugar can do. This is a very sweet late harvest style, suited to fruity desserts..
