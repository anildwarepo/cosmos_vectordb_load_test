country: Chile.
description: Chilean wine folk have been saying that we should watch Limarí for cool-climate Chardonnay. This example is clean and medium-weight, with aromas of apple and pear. The acidity is high and scouring, yet some creamy oak and resin moderate any lean qualities. Could stand to be a touch less resiny but still it ranks as nice Chilean Chardonnay.
