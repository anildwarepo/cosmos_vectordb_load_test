country: US.
description: This is always a topflight bottling, and winemaker Ron Bunnell gets the same rows and uses the same barrel regimen and winemaking methods. So what is different? Vintage variation. In 2006 the wines are tighter and slower to open, perhaps longer lived, and show less of the immediately seductive fruit flavors of 2005. Boushey-McPherson is naturally sharp and edgy when young anyway, and those characteristics are much in evidence here, so this is a wine to decant if you plan to drink it anytime soon..
