Get up close and personal with the paintings, examine brushwork and colors in great detail, and listen to George & Ilone Kremer - the founders of the collection - explain what is special about each painting. George Kremer: “Our journey as collectors has always been about finding the highest quality artworks and simultaneously finding ways to share them with as many people as possible. My wife Ilone and I believe we can make a greater contribution to the art world by investing in technology rather than in bricks and mortar for our collection.”“First there were museums, then private museums and now  virtual reality privately owned museums are entering the scene” Melanie Gerlis, Financial Times“Virtual Reality Museum Puts Rembrandt in High-Def” - Molly Schuetz, Bloomberg - “The Newest Home for Rembrandt and the Dutch Masters Is Gorgeous Outer-Space Museum” -  Brian Boucher, artnet“At the new Kremer Museum, the lighting is perfectly optimized to accentuate the colors, brushstrokes, and details in each painting” - Sarah Burke Artsy“By far the best VR experience I’ve seen so far” - Nikolaus Weil, Entrepreneur (Mindex, SingularityU Germany) & Film Producer - Earth and Deep BlueRead moreCollapse.

Also the newly added Spatial Audio, swipe to turn feature and 6-DoF device (like Mirage Solo) support make it more satisfied to use. For Mirage Solo users, remember to turn off the ""force WorldSense on 3-DoF App"" toggle since it will break some feature..
