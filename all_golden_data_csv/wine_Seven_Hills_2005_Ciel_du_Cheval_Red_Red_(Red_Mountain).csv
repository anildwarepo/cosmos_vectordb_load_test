wine_Seven_Hills_2005_Ciel_du_Cheval_Red_Red_(Red_Mountain),"Unnamed: 0: 107400.
country: US.
description: A beautifully structured Bordeaux blend from one of Washington's great vineyards. This spent about 18 months in French oak, and another 9–10 months in bottle. It is sleek and somewhat austere at first, but sculpted and evocative, with subtle, mixed fruits and impressions of steel and gunpowder. As the fruit comes up it shows some pretty blackberry and black cherry character, nicely balanced and set to evolve over the next decade or more..
