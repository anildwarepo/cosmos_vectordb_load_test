country: France.
description: A lovely touch of orange zest teases the nose and there also is a lovely hint of chervil. The streamlined palate comes in with bundled citrus notes. The tart flesh of tangerine and the zest of lemon are softened and enriched with orange oil and ample concentration. This is pure and racy, linear and bold. There is something salty and energetic, something incredibly fresh and vibrant at the core. The palate and finish are absolutely dry, the echo is long and clean. Blastingly fresh right now, sure to evolve. Drink 2019–2037..
