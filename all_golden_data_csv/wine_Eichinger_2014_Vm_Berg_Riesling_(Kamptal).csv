country: Austria.
description: A little air is all that is needed to shake the orange and lemon zest flavors awake. This is a feast of ripe citrus: crisp, slender and very, very appetizing. The palate is streamlined and full of drive, with added complexity and texture from lees. Keep sipping to taste all the nuances of citrus—yuzu, tangerine, lemon and bergamot. This poised, pure beauty is delicious now but will last. Drink now till 2025..
