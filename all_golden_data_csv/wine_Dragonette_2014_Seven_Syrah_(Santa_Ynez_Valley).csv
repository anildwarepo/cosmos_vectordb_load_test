wine_Dragonette_2014_Seven_Syrah_(Santa_Ynez_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 51967.
country: US.
description: This bottling, from seven cool climate vineyards, makes a great intro into savory Syrah, showing all that peppery might without shoving it down the throat. Cracked peppercorn is redolent on the nose and palate, with the latter also showing raw lamb and beef char. The sip tends toward soy and leather, but with a core of dried blackberry fruit that's familiar to most palates. The texture is tightly woven..
