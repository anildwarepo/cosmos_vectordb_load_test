wine_Huge_Bear_2006_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Sonoma_County),"Unnamed: 0: 28193.
country: US.
description: This wine was sent to me with little information about the owners, and their Web Site doesn't reveal much. The paperwork says it's from Knights Valley, although the label reads Sonoma County. It's a dry, fairly tannic wine, quite ripe in currants and dark chocolate, with an herbal edge and a firm structure. Aged in 100% new French oak, it impresses for its richness and depth, and could develop over the next 6â€“8 years..
