country: Spain.
description: A spectacularly sweet and rich bruiser, and one that delivers the essence of raisins, toffee and chocolate. This wine hasn't taken one turn south, and it's beckoning to be consumed. The finish is impeccably smooth and rich, and while its luscious to say the least, the amazing thing is its length, which runs a couple of minutes, no joke. A guarantee for anyone who loves the hedonistic combination of sweet fruit, brown sugar and chocolate..
