country: Germany.
description: Racy and deeply mineral, yet buoyantly fruity, this wine embodies the best from the Mosel's fantastic 2015 vintage. It's lavishly forward in ripe yellow peach, apricot and honeydew flavors, yet bracingly high in acidity. Satisfyingly rich in extract yet feather light, it finishes long, with shards of slate and crushed mineral. Stunning already, it should continue to improve through 2030, likely beyond..
