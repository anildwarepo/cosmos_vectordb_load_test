country: Spain.
description: You'll find plenty to like in this bubbly. The aromas are very refined and Champagnesque, with toast, lees, vanilla, spice, charcoal and a waft of citrus. The flavors are similarly of toast and mineral. This is not a fruit-driven wine. It's a little rough around the edges; the bubbles are scoury, not refined. But the price is great, and it is a good value. Should be easy to find, with 90,000 cases produced..
