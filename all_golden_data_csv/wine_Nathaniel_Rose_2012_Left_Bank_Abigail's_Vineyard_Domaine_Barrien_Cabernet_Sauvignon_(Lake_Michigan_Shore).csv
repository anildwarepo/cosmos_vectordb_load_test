description: This eponymous label of winemaker Nathaniel Rose is one of his many endeavors in the Michigan wine scene. While the name “Left Bank” evokes Bordeaux, this is clearly a New World-style red, boasting bouncy fruit aromas of dark cherry and spiced raspberry, with cola and cough-syrup notes in the background. The medium-bodied palate is supported by grainy tannins, yet there's a good balance of juicy, red fruit and streaks of granite..
