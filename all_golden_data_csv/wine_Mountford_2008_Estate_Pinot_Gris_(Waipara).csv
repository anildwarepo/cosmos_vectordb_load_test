country: New Zealand.
description: The only trouble with this bargain-priced version of a vendange tardive Pinot Gris will be finding some, as only 40 cases were imported. At only 11.6% alcohol, there's plenty of sugar left in the wine (67 g/l), concentrated and enriched by the inclusion of 50% botrytis-affected fruit. The impressions are of honeyed pineapple, ripe melon and peach preserves, finishing long and sweet. Delicious now, but should still be good 5â€“6 years down the road..
