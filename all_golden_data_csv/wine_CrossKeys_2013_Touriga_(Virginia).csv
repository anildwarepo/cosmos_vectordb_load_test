country: US.
description: This is an uncommon grape for Virginia, yet nonetheless an interesting showing. Dark, ripe and brooding, this carries blackberry, black-cherry, dried savory herbs and violet aromas and flavors. The palate is dense and concentrated in fruit tones yet a hint of levity appears midway in the form of perfumed violet. Structured, grippy tannins give ample support and depth while streaks of fresh acidity keep everything alive..
