country: France.
description: Ripe notions of juicy pear and hay flowers have a lovely zesty edge on the nose. The palate confirms this with concentrated counterpoints of honeyed fruit and bright citrus zestiness. This is full on and rich, and a touch of residual sweetness gives this extra heft and conviction. It is the citrus freshness that provides structure and direction. The finish is merely off dry, so this will shine alongside various dishes. Drink 2017–2025..
