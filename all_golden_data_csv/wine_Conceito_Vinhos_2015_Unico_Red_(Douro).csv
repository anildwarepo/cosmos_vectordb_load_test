wine_Conceito_Vinhos_2015_Unico_Red_(Douro),"Unnamed: 0: 46007.
country: Portugal.
description: Produced from old vines on the schist slopes of the upper Douro, this is an impressive wine from Carla Costa Ferreira and winemaker-daughter Rita Marques Ferreira. Dark tannins in this still-young wine bring out bitter chocolate flavors as well as enhancing the dense black fruits. Along with the rich structure and concentration, this superb wine has a sense of restrained authority and certainly the ability to age. Drink from 2021..
