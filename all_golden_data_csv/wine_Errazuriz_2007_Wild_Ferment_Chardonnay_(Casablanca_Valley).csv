country: Chile.
description: Your first take on this heavily oaked, natural-yeast Chard is that it's a three-alarm smoke alert. Few, if any, Chilean Chardonnays are this overtly oaky. But the wood is of high quality, and the more time you give it the more you find apple, citrus and spice. Yes, it's still resiny. But the balance and natural character of the wine are very good. Best if you like a New World style with plenty of barrel character..
