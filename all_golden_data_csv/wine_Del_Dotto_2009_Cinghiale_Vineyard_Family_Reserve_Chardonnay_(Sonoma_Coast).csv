country: US.
description: Rich and complex, this dry, terroir-driven wine completely avoids the sweet butter creaminess and jamminess of so many Chardonnays, showcasing instead notes of tropical fruits and pears. It's framed by minerals and even a fresh herbaceousness that suggests the wild plants growing around this Sonoma Coast vineyard. While the oak influences are strong, they are perfectly in keeping with the underlying volume..
