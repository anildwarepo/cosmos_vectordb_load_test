country: England.
description: A touch of honey clings to appetizingly tart red-apple fruit on the nose. The palate brings in a bright streak of lemon freshness that is both countered and enhanced by the fine, creamy mousse. Elegant litheness and an ease of touch elevate flavors to tart, crisp ripeness. The lip-smacking, pure finish reveals lovely brioche notes. Still taut and fresh, it would make a great apéritif. The wine will round out with a little bottle age. Drink 2017–2025..
