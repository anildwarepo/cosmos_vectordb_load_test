country: US.
description: This is 100% varietal, sourced from three excellent Red Mountain vineyards—Klipsun, Kiona and Ciel du Cheval. It seamlessly fuses flavors of fruit, barrel (35% new) and the minerality of the terroir, with a generous midpalate of blackberry and black cherry, soaked in liquorous oak. Highlights of mineral, pepper and a whiff of brioche come into play as well. Lovely as it is already, look for further improvement through 2019–2022..
