country: US.
description: The name refers to the vineyard's unusually steep slopes. The reward for farming such difficult terrain, the owners believe, is complexity, character and concentration. That is certainly the case in 2004, as this is the most dense and focused of the six WillaKenzie releases. It's built upon a solid foundation of black cherry fruit, but elevated with herb, acid and a feathery touch to the tannins. Despite its exceptional heft, the wine manages to feel elegant..
