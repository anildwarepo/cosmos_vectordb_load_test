country: US.
description: To call this Cabernet huge is an understatement. The tannins are hard and dramatic. As for the fruit, you can hardly find strong enough descriptors. It shows blackberry jam and black currants, cassis liqueur and minerals raised to fabulous mountain concentration. Violets and oak add to the equation. Somehow it all balances out, resulting in a wine of unusual grace and power. But it needs age. Drink 2019â€“2031, if not beyond..
