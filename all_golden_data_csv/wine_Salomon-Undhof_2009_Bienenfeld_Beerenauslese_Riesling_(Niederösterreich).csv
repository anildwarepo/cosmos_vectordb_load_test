country: Austria.
description: Golden liquid, a piercing nose, utter musk: these are the first impressions of this fragrant, botrytised win. A topnote of candied lemon hovers above the core flavor of beeswax, while bright, juicily luscious acidity makes the mouth water. This is a concentrated high-wire act, dancing between bundled sweetness and the piercing, enlivening freshness of Riesling acidity. Nothing is cloying; everything bathes in the freshness of the balancing acidity that sharpens the flavors. It's gorgous now, but will last well through 2040..
