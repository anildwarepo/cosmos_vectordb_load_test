country: England.
description: A toasty touch of brioche joins ripe red and yellow-apple notes on the nose. The palate has even more of that autolytic richness, grounding both tart red apple and ripe lemon notes. Fine and creamy, the mousse highlights the fruit freshness while an earthier, toastier, richer background shimmers through enticingly. This harmonious and complex sparkler majors on beautiful development and pristine freshness. Lovely now, it is certain to develop further. Drink 2017–2025..
