wine_Greenstone_2012_Shiraz_(Heathcote),"Unnamed: 0: 38688.
country: Australia.
description: The quality of wines emerging from the partnership of Italian winemaking consultant Alberto Antonini, Australian viticulturist Mark Walpole and U.K.-based Master of Wine David Gleave is impressive. This Shiraz boasts complex aromas of campfire, cracked pepper and cassis married to ample weight and firm, yet silky, texture. The balance is spot-on, being neither too heavy nor too light, with a crisp, long finish. Drink nowâ€“2020, possibly beyond..
