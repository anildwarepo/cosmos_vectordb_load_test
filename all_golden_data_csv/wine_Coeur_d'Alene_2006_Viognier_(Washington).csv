wine_Coeur_d'Alene_2006_Viognier_(Washington),"Unnamed: 0: 37455.
country: US.
description: This is 100% Viognier, different from the winery's varietally labeled version in that it is 100% stainless-steel fermented. The result is a less round and toasty wine, but one that, in this vintage at least, offers more focus and precision. Peach and apricot, tangerine and tropical fruits are on display, and the finish winds down gently, with none of the heat or bitterness that can affect some Viogniers..
