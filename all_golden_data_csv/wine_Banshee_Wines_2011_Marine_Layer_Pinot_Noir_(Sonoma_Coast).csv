country: US.
description: With tight acidity like a squeeze of lemon and a lightness of being, this Pinot can be described as elegant rather than opulent. The feral, exotic flavors of pine cones, wild herbs, tea, raspberries and cola suggest the Fort Ross area. There's an exciting complexity and challenge to this wine. It doesn't dazzle you, but makes you think about it, and will certainly reward pairing with serious foods, as it changes in the glass..
