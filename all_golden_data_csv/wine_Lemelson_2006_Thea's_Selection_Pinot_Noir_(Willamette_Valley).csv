country: US.
description: Thea's Selection is Lemelson's “measuring stick” Pinot Noir, as it is a blend of blocks from the different estate vineyards. This elegant release emphasizes aromas of pungent herbs, lifted with hints of rose petal and briary berry. In the mouth there is a lively, sappy, fruit-centric focus, showing concentrated raspberry (framboise) flavors. In short, a thoroughly delicious bottle that makes the case for blends over most single-vineyard offerings in Oregon..
