Description: Originally published to glowing reviews in 1972, Dow Mossman's extraordinary debut is a sweeping coming-of-age novel that developed a passionate cult following - even as it went out of print for more than twenty years. It recently inspired director Mark Moskowitz's award-winning documentary film Stone Reader, which was embraced by readers across the country and described by Peter Rainer in New York magazine as ""a marvelous literary thriller that gets at the way books can stay with people forever."".
