country: Australia.
description: One of the Hunter Valley's top bottlings, Brokenwood's Graveyard Vineyard is still marked by hints of toasty oak at this young stage in its evolution. Vanilla accents lifted sour cherry and cranberry aromas, but on the palate the flavors darken and deepen, trending toward black cherries and plum. Has a nicely balanced, silky texture in the mouth, then a firm, long finish suggesting cellaring. Drink 2012-2025..
