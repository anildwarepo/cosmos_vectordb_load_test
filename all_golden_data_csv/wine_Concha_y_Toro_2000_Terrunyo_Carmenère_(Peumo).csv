country: Chile.
description: Berry aromas are followed by a round, wholesomeness that can't be criticized. The palate is unlike many a Carmenère because it eschews the herbal, green element that's inherent to the grape, and instead offers plum, blackberry and all the richness one can conjure. A round, finish of light oak and vanilla seals it all in fine fashion. Surely the most jammy, expressive and pure Carmenère that Chile has to offer..
