country: Chile.
description: Aromas of hickory and woodsmoke transition to maple, baked blackberry and cedar upon airing. This five-grape blend is led by Cabernet Sauvignon, but Carmen√®re and Malbec are major players as well. Expect a full-force palate with big tannins and layering. Flavors of hickory, savory berry and barbecue notes match the nose, while the finish is roasted, toasty and meaty in nature. Hold until 2016, then drink through 2022..
