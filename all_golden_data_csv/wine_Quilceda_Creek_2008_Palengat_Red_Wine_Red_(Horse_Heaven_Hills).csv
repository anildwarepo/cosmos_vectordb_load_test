country: US.
description: Quilceda's single-vineyard Bordeaux-style blend is 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Cabernet Franc, 7% Merlot and 3% Petit Verdot, from a vineyard just across the road from Champoux. Dusty and fragrant, it suggests soft leather, toast, caramel and coconut, hiding its fruit at first in a wash of luxurious barrel flavors. That fruit emerges with some hours of decanting, a tart and racy mix of berry and sweet tomato..
