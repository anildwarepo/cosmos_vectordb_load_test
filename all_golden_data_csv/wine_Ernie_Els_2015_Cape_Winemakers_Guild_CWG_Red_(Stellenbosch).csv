country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Louis Strydom. A blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Shiraz and 10% Cinsault, this wine is an infant right now, with closed but concentrated dark-fruit aromas and flavors of cassis, black plum, Bakers chocolate and oak spice. Black plum skin, currant and char flavors unfold on the palate, framed by firm, gripping tannins that linger through the long, dry close. Give this time for the tannins to resolve, allowing the fruit to shine a bit brighter. Drink 2021â€“2025..
