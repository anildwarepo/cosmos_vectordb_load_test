wine_Capitain-Gagnerot_2013__Echézeaux,"Unnamed: 0: 51356.
country: France.
description: This producer, based in Ladoix-Serrigny in the Côte de Beaune also has a small parcel in this Grand Cru in Vosne-Romanée. Like all this producer's wines it was fermented in open tanks before barrel aging. That gives an extra concentration to the ripe fruits and firm tannins. It is an opulent wine, juicy with black fruits and acidity. With its structure, it will certainly age further, so drink from 2019..
