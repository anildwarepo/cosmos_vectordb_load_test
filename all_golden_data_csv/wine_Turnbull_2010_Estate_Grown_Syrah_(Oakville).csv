country: US.
description: What a fine Syrah this is. It's the color of midnight on a moonless night, with just a hint of ruby purple at the rim. The aromatics are closed, but provide tantalizing hints of cedar, jam and pepper. It's in the mouth that this young wine shows its stuff, erupting with sweet chocolate, intensely ripe blackberries and savory smoked meat. The tannins close in on the finish, suggesting that the wine needs time. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2016..
