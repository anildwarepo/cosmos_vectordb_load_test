country: France.
description: Soft notes of honeysuckle hover over the waxy scent of fresh honeycomb. Meadow flowers gild those flavors with honest freshness. The palate holds a gentle softness, letting the honeyed, developed notes of this restrained Gewurztraminer convey both fir-honey bitterness and blossom-sweet ease. This shows supreme balance and seems young and fresh for an eight-year-old wine. It comes from a supreme, balanced and cool year that shows its mettle with age..
