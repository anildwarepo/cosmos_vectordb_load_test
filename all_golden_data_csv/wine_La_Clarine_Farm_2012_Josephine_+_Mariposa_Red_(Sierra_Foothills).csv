country: US.
description: The name comes from the Josephine/Mariposa Complex soils, gravelly loam vineyard underlain with crumbly yellow slate. This is a finely tuned blend of 72% Grenache Noir and 28% Mourvèdre. The aromas are heady in rhubarb compote and wild raspberry with a candied, perfumed character. In taste, it's more bright red fruit with an underlayer of herb and stony minerality. Medium in body, the wine delivers substantial length and depth..
