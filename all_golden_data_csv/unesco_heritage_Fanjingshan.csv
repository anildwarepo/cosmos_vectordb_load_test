unesco_heritage_Fanjingshan,"Name: Fanjingshan.
short_description: <p>Located within the Wuling mountain range in Guizhou Province (south-west China), Fanjingshan ranges in altitude between 500 metres and 2,570 metres above sea level, favouring highly diverse types of vegetation and relief. It is an island of metamorphic rock in a sea of karst, home to many plant and animal species that originated in the Tertiary period, between 65 million and 2 million years ago. The property’s isolation has led to a high degree of biodiversity with endemic species, such as the Fanjingshan Fir (<em>Abies fanjingshanensis</em>) and the Guizhou Snub-nosed Monkey (<em>Rhinopithecus brelichi</em>), and endangered species, such as the Chinese Giant Salamander (<em>Andrias davidianus</em>), the Forest Musk Deer (<em>Moschus berezovskii</em>) and Reeve’s Pheasant (<em>Syrmaticus reevesii</em>). Fanjingshan has the largest and most contiguous primeval beech forest in the subtropical region.</p>.
