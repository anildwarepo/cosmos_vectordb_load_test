wine_Penfolds_2014_Bin_707_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(South_Australia),"Unnamed: 0: 99330.
country: Australia.
description: This Cabernet equivalent to Grange has exploded in price (I remember tasting the 1996 on release when it was $25 per bottle), but there's no questioning the quality. A deep, intense nose of cassis, earth, menthol and cedar is followed by a full, rich palate that's supple without being soft. Brighter notes of red fruit emerge on the lengthy finish, which is dominated by sweet fruit and creamy lactones. Drink 2020â€“2030, and probably well beyond..
