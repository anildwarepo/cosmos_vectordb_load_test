wine_Hall_2013_The_Bishop_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Napa_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 109848.
country: US.
description: This is a blend of the best barrels of the vintage, in this year consisting of fruit primarily from Howell and Diamond mountains, with a touch of estate-grown Merlot. It offers astounding levels of richness and concentration alongside a nuanced approach to bold black fruit and spicy earth, its aromas of blackberry and clove peppered in wild violet. It impresses immediately but also pleads for more time in bottle; enjoy best 2020 through 2028..
