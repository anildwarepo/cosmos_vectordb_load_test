country: France.
description: Bridgitte and her husband Eric took over her family property in 2009, in 2014 producing a spicy and fruity wine. It has fine tannins and sweet red-berry fruit. The acidity and the balance are just right. Drink this attractive wine from 2018. They donate one percent of their turnover to an environmental charity and are (they say) one of only two wineries in the world who are members of “1% for the planet.”.
