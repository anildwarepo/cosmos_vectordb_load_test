country: South Africa.
description: This blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Shiraz, 5% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc, 5% Malbec and 5% Petit Verdot opens with aromas of church incense, brambly berry, cherry cola and fruit cake. The palate shows a bit more restraint, offering flavors of small red berries and cherries that are dusted with baking spices. Structured tannins lend ample grip to the medium-weight palate, while moderate acidity lifts the red fruit flavors through the close. Drink nowâ€“2021..
