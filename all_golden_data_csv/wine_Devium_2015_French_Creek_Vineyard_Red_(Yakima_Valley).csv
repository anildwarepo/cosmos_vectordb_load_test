country: US.
description: The inaugural release from this winery from Sleight of Hand Cellars' production winemaker Keith Johnson is a blend of Mourvèdre (90%), Syrah (8%) and Grenache Blanc. Stylistically somewhat unique for Washington, it brings brooding aromas of sauvage, herb, smoked meat and white pepper, along with a bit of reduction. The fruit flavors are pure and bring an appealing sense of texture. Give it time to open up and pair it with food to see it at its best..
