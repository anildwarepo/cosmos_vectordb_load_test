wine_Kramer_2007_Merlot_(Walla_Walla_Valley_(OR)),"Unnamed: 0: 11743.
country: US.
description: Not sure which vineyard sourced the grapes, but this is a flavorful, ready-to-drink bottle of wine. There is substantial evidence of aging in expensive new oak barrels, with a lot of coconut flavor over toast, chocolate and cherry. Tannins are soft and the fruit is round and luscious; except for a slight fall-off in the finish this could be from any one of a number of well-known Walla Walla wineries..
