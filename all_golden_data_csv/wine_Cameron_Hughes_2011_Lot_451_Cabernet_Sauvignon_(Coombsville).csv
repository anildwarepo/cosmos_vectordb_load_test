country: US.
description: Coombsville has emerged as the hottest appellation in Napa Valley, and Cameron Hughes is right there, doing his negociant thing. The Cabernet was blended with Malbec and Merlot, and the wine is fantastically satisfying. Its rich, sturdy tannins frame elaborate blackberry, blueberry, red currant and smoky oak flavors that are wonderfully complex, with an elegant, balanced finish. This is an unbelievable price for a Cabernet of this high quality..
