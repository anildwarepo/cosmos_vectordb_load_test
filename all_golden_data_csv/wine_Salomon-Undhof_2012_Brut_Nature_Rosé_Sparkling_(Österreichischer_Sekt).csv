country: Austria.
description: The brazing lemon freshness of this non-dosed pink sparkler almost sweeps across all the delicious strawberry fruit contained within. The refreshment factor is supreme but if you care to look, there are subtle shades of tart berries: redcurrant and wild strawberry. The slender palate is streamlined, a fact made even more compelling by the very fine, persistent but unobtrusive mousse. This is a sophisticated, sparkling rosé, with a spring in its step and a glint in its eye..
