wine_Jackson_Estate_2013_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Sonoma_County),"Unnamed: 0: 62541.
country: US.
description: This wine is made from a collection of vineyards dotted along mountainous ridge lines and benchlands, most of these spots along the Mayacamas Mountains. Winemaker Randy Ullom captures a classic character of dried sage, cedar and pencil shavings here, supporting the savory with bright acidity and a strong presence of tannin. This wine could stand more time in the bottle before enjoying; its youthful grip doesn't go without notice..
