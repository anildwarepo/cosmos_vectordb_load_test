wine_Abrazo_2001_Garnacha_(Cariñena),"Unnamed: 0: 111197.
country: Spain.
description: Full and minty, and quite the bargain at five bucks. This bargain buster features some cherry liqueur and sucking-candy flavors, while the finish is not devoid of some class, as it offers coffee and chocolate notes. Yes, it's a bit like cherry soda without the bubbles, but what's not to like at this price, especially if the menu calls for burgers or London broil? If Two Buck Chuck is so popular, try giving this wine “hug,” the English translation for abrazo. Best Buy..
