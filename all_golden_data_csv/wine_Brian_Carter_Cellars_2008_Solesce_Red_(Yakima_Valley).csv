country: US.
description: This Bordeaux-style blend is 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, with the balance a mix of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec. It's a sophisticated blend that retains its youthful freshness. Deep flavors run from black cherry through cassis, adding streaks of licorice, baking chocolate and a hint of bark and herb. Supple, graceful and polished, this wine would seem to have another decade of life ahead..
