Description: Michael Hordern stars as Jeeves with Richard Briers as Bertie in a BBC Radio full-cast dramatization. Just when Bertie thinks that all's right with the world, there's young Bingo Little, who's in love for the umpteenth time and needs Bertie to put in a good word for him with his uncle; Aunt Agatha, who forces Bertie to get engaged to the formidable Honoria Glossop; and friction in the Wooster home over a red cummerbund, purple socks and some snazzy old Etonian spats. Only the inimitable Jeeves can save the day..
