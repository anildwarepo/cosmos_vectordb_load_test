country: US.
description: The wine comes from a particular portion of the estate vineyard, and is almost entirely Syrah, with a splash of Grenache. It is a brilliant wine, entirely New World, and impressive even by California and Australia standards. Massively rich in cherry, chocolate, cassis, licorice, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors, the '05 Bone Rock is softly tannic and compulsively drinkable, although the alcohol, 16.1%, is considerable. Best now and for a year or two..
