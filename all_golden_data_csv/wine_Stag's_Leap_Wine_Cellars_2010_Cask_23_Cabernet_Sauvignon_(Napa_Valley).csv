country: US.
description: This 100% Cabernet is a blend of the winery's S.L.V. and Fay vineyards, and one of the most famous bottlings in Napa Valley. But the 2010 simply is not in the same league of past bottlings. It's pleasant with rich blackberry, cherry, cocoa and new oak flavors, all wrapped up with fine tannins. But it doesn't deliver that ""wow!"" factor, especially at this price, and it doesn't seem particularly ageworthy. Blame it on the erratic vintage. Drink nowâ€“2015..
