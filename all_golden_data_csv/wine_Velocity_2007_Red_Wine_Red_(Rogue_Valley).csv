description: With each successive vintage, winemaker Gus Janeway has slowly but surely moved this wine to 100% Malbec. It's a bold step, because pure varietal wines do not have the advantage of filling in holes with blending. But for those who want to glimpse the future of Malbec in southern Oregon, this is a touch point. Delicate, balanced, herbal, mixing a wash of light fruits with nuances of herb, this very drinkable wine has appealing delicacy and verve..
