country: US.
description: Every intervention available to the winemaker for creating richness has been applied here, including 75% new French oak. California Chardonnay hardly gets more extravagant in buttercream, smoky toast, lemon drop, apple butter and pear flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Grown in one of the coolest areas of the appellation, yet it's so rich and full bodied, it almost has the body of a red wine. Don't let it get too cold, and pay attention as it warms and evolves in the glass..
