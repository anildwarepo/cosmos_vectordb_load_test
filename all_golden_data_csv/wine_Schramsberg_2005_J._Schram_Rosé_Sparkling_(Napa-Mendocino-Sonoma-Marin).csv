country: US.
description: An enormously  complex wine, but one that's not quite ready for prime time. Mainly Chardonnay, with 21% Pinot Noir, this was aged on its lees for seven years, giving it a soft creaminess and also an intense, doughy yeastiness. The raspberry, lime, toast and vanilla flavors are rich and slightly honeyed. With brisk acidity and slight scouriness, it wants a good eight years in the cellar, and should age well beyond that..
