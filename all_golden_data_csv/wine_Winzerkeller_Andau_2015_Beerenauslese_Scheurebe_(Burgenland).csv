country: Austria.
description: Honey and barley sugar dance on the nose. They also vie for attention on the unctuous palate where their rich and decadent sweetness is revealed. This, however, is countered by an acidic thrill of pure lemon, suggesting candied lemon peel in a sea of rich caramel. A touch of passion fruit can be glimpsed, too. The interaction between these opposing poles creates tension in this lip-smacking, lemony- bright wine..
