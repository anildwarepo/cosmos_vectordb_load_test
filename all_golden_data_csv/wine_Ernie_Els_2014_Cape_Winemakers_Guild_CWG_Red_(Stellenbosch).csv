country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Louis Strydom. This Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant blend, with 30% Shiraz and 10% Merlot, opens with a lovely m√©lange of just-ripe aromas of blackberry, cassis and black plum, laced with notes of licorice, blackcurrant leaf and toasted whole spice. The mouthfeel is robust and full, with assertive tannins that lend a firm structure and perfectly frame the ripe black-fruit flavors. Flavors of plum skin, wood spice and bittersweet cocoa hang on endlessly to the finish. It's delicious now, but still a baby, with plenty of maturing and evolution ahead; try after 2020 and through 2026..
