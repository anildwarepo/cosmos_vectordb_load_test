country: Italy.
description: New leather, menthol, woodland berry, dark spice and a whiff of pressed rose petal are just some of the scents you'll find on this radiant red. Vibrant and loaded with finesse, the structured palate delivers juicy Maraca cherry, cranberry, white pepper, star anise and a hint of pipe tobacco while youthfully taut noble tannins and firm acidity provide an age-worthy framework. It's already stunning but needs time to develop to its full potential. Drink 2023–2043..
