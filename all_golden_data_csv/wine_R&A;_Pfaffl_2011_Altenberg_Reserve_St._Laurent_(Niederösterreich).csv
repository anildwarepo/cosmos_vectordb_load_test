country: Austria.
description: There is something subliminally medicinal about these aromas—the ethereal lift of herbal tinctures alloyed with dark plum and a generous dash of white pepper. This is not for beginners looking for easy fruit notes, but rather for those who like to converse with their wine. This layered, compelling and balanced glassful will provide food for thought with its finely structured tannins, medium body and bundles of flavor..
