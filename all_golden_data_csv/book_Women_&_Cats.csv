Description: ""This anthology of quotations, letters, poems, stories, and essay excerpts—delicately and elegantly illustrated with small silhouettes and old tinted photographs in sepia and pink—celebrates the love affair between women and cats. Insightful gems include “Of course, every cat is really the most beautiful woman in the room”; “Women and cats will do as they please and men and dogs should relax and get used to the idea”; and “Flirting, falling, and yawning anywhere, / Like women who want no contract.” Included are selections from Colette, Mark Twain, Eleanor Glyn, Fanny Kemble, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Amy Lowell, Katherine Mansfield, Dorothy L. Sayers, Rosa Luxemburg, and Hedda Hopper."".
