country: Spain.
description: This is a young but excellent gran reserva, so it's gritty-smelling in its youth, with aromas of blackberry and cassis. Racy acidity pushes the focus on the palate towards the upper tier, while flavors of lactic oak, lemon peel, tobacco and mocha share the stage with plum and berry fruit. Finishing flavors of vanilla and raw oak are supported by good acidity and just enough pulp. Drink through 2030..
