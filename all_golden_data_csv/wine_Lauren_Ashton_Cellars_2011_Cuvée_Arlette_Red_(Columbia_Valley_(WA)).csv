country: US.
description: Winemaker Kit Singh has tweaked this Right Bank-style blend, but it remains solidly anchored in 49% Merlot and 29% Cabernet Franc, with a small amount of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. Tart, young raspberry and pomegranate fruit flavors are set against vividly crisp mineral notes. Tannins are supple and proportionate and the flavors beautifully defined. On the finish, a delightful detail of carpaccio appears..
