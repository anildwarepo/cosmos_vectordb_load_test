wine_Hamilton_Russell_2015_Chardonnay_(Hemel_en_Aarde),"Unnamed: 0: 49507.
country: South Africa.
description: Clean, bright and focused, this is currently showing its youth, though with great promise to continue to mature and flesh out with another couple of years. Notes of yellow apple, beeswax, straw and honeysuckle abound on the nose, while flavors of orange oil and honeycomb flesh out the medium-weight palate, with great verve and lingering spicy elements through the close. It's approachable now, but should drink best from 2018â€“2021..
