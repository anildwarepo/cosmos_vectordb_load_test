wine_Toil_Oregon_2014_Pinot_Noir_(Willamette_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 115836.
country: US.
description: Toil spearheads an ambitious Oregon project for Chris Figgins (Leonetti Cellar and the Figgins Family). A new vineyard is being developed in the Chehalem Mountains; meanwhile grapes are sourced from Ribbon Ridge and the Eola-Amity Hills. This svelte generous wine still has some baby fat from barrel aging in 30% new French oak. Cherry, cola and toasty oak flavors come together with a touch of underbrush. It's best to give this another year or two of bottle age. Drink it 2020 to 2026..
