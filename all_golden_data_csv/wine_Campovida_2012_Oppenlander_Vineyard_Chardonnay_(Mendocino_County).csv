description: Campovida continues to impress with its newly released white wines, producing this crisp, sharp and lemon-y Chardonnay from the beautiful Oppenlander Vineyard, settled in the tiny coastal-kissed town of Comptche. The lemon hits first, followed by a distinct layer of green apple and even a hint of floral fig. With graceful acidity, this is a perfect white for the dinner table, not too high in alcohol at 13.1%, too..
