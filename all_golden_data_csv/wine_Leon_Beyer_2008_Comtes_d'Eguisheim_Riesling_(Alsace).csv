country: France.
description: Lifted peach and chamomile just hint at the maturity of this wine that has barely begun its trajectory. The palate is still taut and firm, fresh with lemon zest and singing with an evolved, lifted purity. This does not need sweetness to propel its flavor: its slender poise and purity make it soar on its own. The more you taste, the more you find: drops of soy, glints of stone, shimmers of citrus and lanolin. It's gorgeous, concentrated, incisive and long..
