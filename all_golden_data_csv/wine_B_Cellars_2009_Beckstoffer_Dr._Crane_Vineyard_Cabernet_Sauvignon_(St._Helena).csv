description: This Dr. Crane vineyard has really rocked in recent vintages. Enormously rich and deep, with a fabulous compaction of black currant, dark chocolate, baking spice and cedar flavors. There's an interesting grilled meatiness, like the charred fat on a great steak, and lots of new oak, but it's perfectly integrated. The smoky, toasty barrel notes are perfect companions to the fruit's power. Drink this 100% Cab now and over the next 12â€“15 years..
