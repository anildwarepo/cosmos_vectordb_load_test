country: US.
description: This is easily the richest, densest, most complex of Marimar's 2007 Chardonnays. Made with extended lees contact, it has a fleshy, yeasty freshness that gives the wine extra layers. The grape flavors show typical Green Valley long hangtime notes of exotic tropical fruits, apricots, pears, honey, buttered toast, crème brûlée and sweet baking spices, brightened with acidity. A luxurious, splendid Chardonnay to drink now..
