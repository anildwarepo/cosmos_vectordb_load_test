country: France.
description: Importer and Master Sommelier Fran Kysela uses the Maison du Midi label for lots of Rhône wines he selects to bring into the U.S. This effort, from Plan de Dieu, is seriously intense, full-bodied and firmly tannic, showing the character of the vintage. The plummy fruit is powerful, fighting through the tannins on the finish. Try it young with rare beef, or put it away for a few years and see if the tannins soften over time..
