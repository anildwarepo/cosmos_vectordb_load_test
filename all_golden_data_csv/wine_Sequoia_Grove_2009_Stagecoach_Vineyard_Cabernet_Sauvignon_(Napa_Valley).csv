country: US.
description: Tiers of blackberry jam, plum, milk chocolate, anise and smoky cedar flavors mark this layered Cabernet. It shows the thrilling balance of the vineyard, with ripe fruit in tension with minerals, brisk acidity and wonderful mountain tannins. A splash of Merlot and Cabernet Franc add soft, cherried relief to Cabernet's hardness. Drink this wine now and over the next 15 years, as it gradually sheds its fruit..
