country: France.
description: Glowingly ripe apricot and pear notes make for an enticing nose. These notions become even fruitier and more honeyed on the palate where they shine with ripeness and generosity. Beautifully bright and zesty lemon freshness counters this and creates a dry lip-smacking finish that celebrates all that is ripe, rounded and generous about this lovely clean fruit. Plumpness and freshness strike an absolutely delicious balance. The finish is zesty and long. At five years of age, this has barely begun to develop. Drink 2017–2030..
