country: US.
description: This 100% Cabernet, from the iconic Klipsun vineyard, has been sourced from the original 1989 planting since the first crop, making Seven Hills Klipsun's longest standing customer. This offers deep cassis, mineral, and earth flavors, powerful and dense. The Seven Hills style, ordinarily restrained and elegant, suits this vineyard especially well, as it reins in the tendency of Klipsun fruit to go over the top, and become too tannic. This is muscular and deep, but proportionate and detailed..
