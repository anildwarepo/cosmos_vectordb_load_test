country: Italy.
description: Sperss (the name is inspired by the local word for “nostalgia”) is a vineyard located in the Barolo territory of Serralunga. Angelo Gaja adds 6% Barbera to the wine for brightness and freshness but the overall ensemble shows so much more than that. It delivers sophisticated softness and a velvety texture that is backed by exotic spice and loads of wild berry and licorice. Add huge depth and intensity and you have the criteria for a cellar-worthy wine. Will be ready to drink after 2020..
