wine_Clau_de_Nell_2014_Grolleau_(Val_de_Loire),"Unnamed: 0: 62545.
country: France.
description: This is one of three wines produced by the estate created by the late Anne-Claude Leflaive of Domaine Leflaive in Burgundy. This wine uses the very local Grolleau, grown biodynamically. Unusually this is a red wine (Grolleau is normally found in ros√©). The wine is lightly stalky with red-currant fruit and intense acidity. It is light in texture but rich in complexity, and has some aging potential. Drink now, but better from 2018..
