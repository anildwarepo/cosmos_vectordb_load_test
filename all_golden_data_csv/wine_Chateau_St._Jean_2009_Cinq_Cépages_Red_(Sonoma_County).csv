country: US.
description: Another superb Cinq Cépages. A blend of all five classic Bordeaux grape varieties-, but based on Cabernet Sauvignon, it is both immediately pleasurable and intensely complex. Waves of black currants, dark chocolate, green olives, licorice and toasty oak roll across the palate, wrapped into firm, dusty tannins. Very good now but should develop further over the next 8–10 years. Easy to find, with 5,500 cases produced..
