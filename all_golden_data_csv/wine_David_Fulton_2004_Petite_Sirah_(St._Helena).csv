country: US.
description: Here's your basic thermonuclear Petite Sirah. It's huge, powerful, triumphant in its own varietal way. Has the soft lushness and immediate succulence of a modern cult Cabernet, with a vast array of chocolate, blackberry, blueberry and cherry pie filling flavors that are almost candied, but the finish is thoroughly dry. With its firm tannins, it should live for many years. If you're a “Pet” fan, this is the one to buy..
