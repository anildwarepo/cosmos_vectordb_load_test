Description: A beautiful retelling of the last week in the life of Jesus Christ (from John 13-21), including 17 dramatic illustrations by Rob Pepper. This unique work captures the urgency of the last living disciple telling his students about the most significant event in history. It includes first person commentary told in John's voice with comments from Matthew, Mark, and Luke. The compelling story gives the reader the sense of being around a campfire with first century believers, hearing the story directly from John. So come into the story, smell the mixture of the salty air and billows of smoke floating from the bonfire and hear the Last Eyewitness..
