.
Description: These fried soft-shell crabs are lightly breaded and cook in minutes. They're golden brown and crisp on the outside, tender and sweet on the inside..
.
Ingredients:.
- 4 soft-shell crabs.
- 1 quart oil for frying, or as needed.
- 0.5 cup milk.
- 1 large egg.
- 1 cup all-purpose flour.
- salt and pepper to taste.
.
Instructions:.
- Lift one pointed side of the top shell of one crab; pull out and discard the gills. Lower the shell and repeat on the other side. Remove the tail flap on the bottom side by twisting and pulling. Use a pair of scissors to cut behind the eyes and remove the face. Repeat to clean remaining crabs. Rinse cleaned crabs thoroughly with cold water, then dry on paper towels..
- Heat oil in a deep fryer to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C)..
- Whisk together milk and egg in a shallow bowl. Combine flour, salt, and pepper in another shallow bowl. Lightly salt each crab. Dredge in flour; shake off excess. Dip into beaten egg. Lift up so excess egg drips back into the bowl. Press into flour to coat both sides..
- Working in batches if necessary, carefully lower crabs into the hot oil and fry until golden brown on one side, 1 to 2 minutes. Carefully turn and cook until golden brown on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes more. Drain on paper towels..
