description: Winemaker: Johan Malan. This mature beauty still has plenty of life left in it, as vibrant notes of orange peel, apple skin and wood-grilled peach are met with complementary tones of honeycomb, candied ginger and toasted challah. The palate is full and creamy, but very bright, with mouthwatering acidity that cuts through the rich baked apple, pear butter and toasted sweet spice flavors. Drink now–2020..
