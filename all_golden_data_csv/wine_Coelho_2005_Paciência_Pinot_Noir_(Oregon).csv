country: US.
description: Assertive and spicy, this interesting bottling, from Amity vineyard estate grapes, shows that even at just 13% alcohol Oregon Pinot can cut it. Made in a distinctive style that is clearly neither California nor Burgundy, this herbal, intense, wine puts the focus on the aromas, a beguiling mix of pine and herb. But the fruit is there right behind, tart and sassy, with cola and root beer notes sliding into a well-modulated but tannic finish..
