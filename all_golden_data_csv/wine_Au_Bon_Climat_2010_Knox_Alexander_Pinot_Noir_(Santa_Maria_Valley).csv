country: US.
description: This low production Pinot Noir will be scooped up by sommeliers who understand how good it is with so many of their entr√©es. The alcohol is modest, and the oak is in the background despite being comprised of 75% new French barrels. That's because the raspberry, cola and tea flavors are so strong, they're able to stand for themselves. The grape source is from Jim Clendenen's personal Le Bon Climat Vineyard and Bien Nacido. All in all, this is a gorgeous Pinot that will continue to impress over the next six years..
