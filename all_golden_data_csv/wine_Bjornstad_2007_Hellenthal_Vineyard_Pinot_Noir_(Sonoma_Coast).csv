wine_Bjornstad_2007_Hellenthal_Vineyard_Pinot_Noir_(Sonoma_Coast),"Unnamed: 0: 45804.
country: US.
description: There's a wildland, coastal mountain taste to this wine, which brims with bone-dry, exotic, woodsy tastes of wild forest cherries, fennel, balsam, cola, volcanic minerals, raw beef and Asian spices, not to mention the sweet veneer of sandalwood. It's utterly distinct from other Pinots in its almost feral complexity, a wine that changes with every sniff and sip. Should develop through 2014. This is a great price for a Pinot Noir of this integrity and interest. Only 152 cases were produced, but it's worth the search..
