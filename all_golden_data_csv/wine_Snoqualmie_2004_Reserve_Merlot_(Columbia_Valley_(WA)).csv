wine_Snoqualmie_2004_Reserve_Merlot_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 46382.
country: US.
description: Although it's just a guess, it seems clear that Snoqualmie was the loser in 2004, when so many small wineries were helped out by Chateau Ste. Michelle, which provided them grapes during a bad freeze year. Snoqualmie probably should not have made a reserve under the circumstances, as this falls well short of recent efforts. It's a light and simple wine, with thin candy cherry flavors and herbal streaks..
