title: The Ass Carrying Relics.
text: An ass, with relics for his load,Supposed the worship on the roadMeant for himself alone,And took on lofty airs,Receiving as his ownThe incense and the prayers.Some one, who saw his great mistake,Cried, “Master Donkey, do not makeYourself so big a fool.Not you they worship, but your pack;They praise the idols on your back,And count yourself a paltry tool.”‘Tis thus a brainless magistrateIs honour’d for his robe of state..
