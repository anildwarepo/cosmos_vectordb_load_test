country: US.
description: Despite coming from declassified barrels from the winery's other programs, the quality still hits a very high mark on this blend of Cabernet Franc (33%), Cabernet Sauvignon (29%), Merlot (29%) and Petit Verdot. The aromas of cranberry, herbs, plum and mineral are generous followed by good depth to the fruit flavors and bitters on the finish. As always with this winery, it's the balance of acid and tannins that most impresses. Give a one hour decant..
