wine_Amity_2013_Riesling_(Willamette_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 15211.
country: US.
description: The deep gold color of this relatively young wine suggests that oxidation is setting in. But wait! This wine explodes into full glory 24 hours after first being opened. It begins with intense aromas and flavors of dried apricots, apples and a hint of ginger, showing impressive length on the finish. It turns into a breathtaking, spätlese-style effort on the palate, with honey, Meyer lemon and ripe grapefruit flavors..
