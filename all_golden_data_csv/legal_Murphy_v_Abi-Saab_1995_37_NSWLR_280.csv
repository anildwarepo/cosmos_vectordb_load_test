The respondent Commissioner lodge with the Court and with the taxpayer applicants draft declarations and/or orders giving effect to the reasons for judgment within fourteen days, including orders as to costs. 45 Those principles are conceivably open to be applied to the wider circumstances of the operation of the assessment scheme of the Tax Act, albeit in the context of the earlier concluded Spassked proceedings having fallen for decision-making in relation to the 1992 fiscal year alone. The difficulty is in defining in any particular case the notion of a ' whole case ', and in identification of ' every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation'. Henderson did not of course involve a fiscal issue arising in the administrative context of annual assessment. Furthermore the principle enunciated in Henderson was expressed in terms of res judicata , upon which doctrine the Commissioner has however withheld from reliance in the context of the present strike-out proceedings, though in that regard, the doctrine of res judicata is more broadly conceived and has received a broader application in United Kingdom contexts. Moreover in income tax contexts, traditional pleadings are not usually implemented; in that regard in Murphy v Abi-Saab (1995) 37 NSWLR 280 at 287, it was observed by Gleeson CJ (with whose reasons for judgment Kirby P and Rolfe AJA agreed) that '... an issue of fact or law may be easier to decide where there are pleadings than where... there was simply a summons' . In any event, I think that in substance and in reality, IEL as the intermediate and in the present context the effectively controlling parent company did cause its subsidiary Spassked to bring forward the 'whole case' of IEL's relevant subsidiaries (ie Spassked, IEF and QTH). 49 The Commissioner concluded submissions in outline in chief as follows: (i) the deductibility of Spassked's interest outgoings in all of the applicable years was central to Spassked's case in the earlier concluded Spassked proceedings; (ii) Spassked was given a full opportunity to litigate its claim to deduct the interest incurred on its IEF borrowings in the earlier Spassked proceedings; (iii) the Full Court made explicit findings concerning the deductibility of Spassked's interest outgoings in all applicable years, and made orders consequential upon those findings; each of the taxpayer applicants have sought findings and orders contrary to findings and orders previously made by the Federal Court below and on appeal; (iv) there would be manifest oppression and unfairness to the Commissioner, if the present application for summary judgment was to be dismissed; in the dictum cited earlier in Murphy , the Commissioner would thereby '... be vexed twice with the same claim'; (v) the balancing of justice overall favours the conclusion that it would be unduly oppressive to the Commissioner, and wasteful of the Federal Court's resources, for Spassked and the other taxpayer applicants to be given 'an opportunity to re-litigate' the earlier concluded Spassked proceedings. I should add that the Commissioner also addressed in chief, in anticipation of the contrary view of the taxpayer applicants, that IEF and QTH were privies of Spassked for the purpose of the operation of the doctrines of issue estoppel and Anshun estoppel, since each acquired income tax losses from Spassked in their capacity as wholly owned subsidiaries of IEL, as was also Spassked. It is appropriate that I address that less relatively complex issue for the most part in my final segment of conclusions to these reasons for judgment. 118 Further as to the operation in Australia of both issue and Anshun estoppels, the latter having been described by Gleeson CJ in Murphy at 286 as ' a wider form of estoppel' , the Commissioner contended that the critical findings of the earlier concluded Spassked proceedings I have extracted also related to or involved 'ultimate facts which form ingredients in the cause of action' ( Blair v Curran at 532), and which were so closely connected with the subject matter of the earlier concluded Spassked proceedings that it was to be expected that the same would be subsequently relied on by the Commissioner in relation to fiscal years additional to 1992 (see again the full context of the dicta I have earlier cited from Anshun and Henderson ). I further bear in mind that issue estoppel operates in relation not just to the prior litigating parties but also to their respective privies ( Rogers ), and hence persons or entities claiming under or through or by virtue of the legal rights of such parties ( Effem ). I think that it should be concluded that each of the taxpayer applicants qualify as privies of each other, and of their common wholly owning parent IEL, for the purposes of the operation of doctrines as to issue estoppel and Anshun estoppel, being a qualification in any event not seemingly required to be fulfilled in the case of the wider and more comprehensive notion of abuse of process. Each of IEL and its wholly owned subsidiaries here involved, being of course each of the taxpayer applicants, was subjected to the evident decision-making corporate mind of IEL as parent company..
