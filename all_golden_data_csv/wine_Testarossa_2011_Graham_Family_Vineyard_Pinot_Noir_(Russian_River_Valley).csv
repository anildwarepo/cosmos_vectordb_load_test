wine_Testarossa_2011_Graham_Family_Vineyard_Pinot_Noir_(Russian_River_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 128146.
country: US.
description: This wine, from one of the coolest parts of the Russian River Valley, has hints of the mushroomy earthiness that plagues some 2011 Pinot Noirs. But for whatever reason (good viticulture and careful sorting are likely), that slight unripeness remains only in the background as a complex counter to the tart cranberries, cherries and cola. The wine is marked by dryness and bright acidity. Surely it wants some time in the bottle. Drink after 2017..
