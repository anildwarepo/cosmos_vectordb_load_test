country: US.
description: Outstanding vineyard sources (Dineen, Gamache and Northridge) and a deft blending touch combine here in a supple, complex and beautifully balanced Cabernet Sauvignon. There are spotlights of fresh herb and peavine mingled among the broader flavors of wild berries, all with a toasty underpinning from 20 months in a mix of new, once-used, and neutral French oak. Drink now or cellar for another 6–8 years..
