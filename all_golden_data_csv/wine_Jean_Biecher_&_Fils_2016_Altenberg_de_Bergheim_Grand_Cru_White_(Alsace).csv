country: France.
description: The nose opens with a concentrated hit of ripe clementine peel, underneath this notions of mirabelle and pear shimmer. The palate is concentrated and full but appears much lighter—a combination of fresh acidity and an alluring touch of residual sweetness do their best to add a spring to the step of this unusual but captivating wine. Scintillating hints of mandarin peel, honeysuckle and kumquat make this incredibly moreish. The finish is off dry to medium sweet. Lovely now, but it's sure to last. Try with cheeses or spicy Asian dishes. Drink 2017–2027..
