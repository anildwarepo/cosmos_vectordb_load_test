country: US.
description: Thea's, the blended offering in Lemelson's stable of single vineyard Pinots, advances the idea that blends are often the most complete wines in a lineup. Though each of Lemelson's single vineyard wines has its own unique particularity, this wine takes the best of them and gracefully pulls them all together. A gentle mix of spice, floral, mocha, forest and chocolate streaks, it is buttressed with firm purple fruits and polished tannins..
