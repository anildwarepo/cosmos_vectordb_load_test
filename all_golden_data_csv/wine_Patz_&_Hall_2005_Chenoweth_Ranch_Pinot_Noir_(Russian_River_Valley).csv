country: US.
description: This is one of the most successful Pinots the winery has produced, and I have no doubt it's because the vintage was so cool. The wine is absolutely dry and has bracing acidity, with extraordinarily long, deep flavors of grapes that achieved maximum ripeness but remain balanced. Cherries, raspberries and blackberries flood the palate, enriched with earthier notes of balsam, cola, soy, licorice and spice. Drink now through 2011..
