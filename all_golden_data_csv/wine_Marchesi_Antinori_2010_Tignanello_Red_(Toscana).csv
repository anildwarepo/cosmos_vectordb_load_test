country: Italy.
description: Black berry, plum, red currant and cedar aromas take center stage in this fantastic vintage of one of Italy's most iconic wines. The structured, poised palate delivers a great depth of flavors that include succulent black cherry, cracked black pepper and mocha that are energized by a flinty mineral note. Smooth and balanced with polished tannins and fresh acidity, this is already delicious but hold for complexity. Drink 2015–2030..
