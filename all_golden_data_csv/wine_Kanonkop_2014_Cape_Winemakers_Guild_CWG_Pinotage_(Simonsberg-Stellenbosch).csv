country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Abrie Beeslaar. A seductive streak of pressed purple flowers adds depth to the lightly smoky and spicy blackberry, black cherry and plum fruit aromas. The ripe fruit flavors dominate the palate at first, with secondary flavors of char, black tea and sweet smoke that unfold and carry through to the lingering finish. The tannins lend good structure and grip, while ample acidity lends good balance to the fruit richness. This should develop and mature well, revealing more nuance and additional complexities with more time. Drink 2019â€“2024..
