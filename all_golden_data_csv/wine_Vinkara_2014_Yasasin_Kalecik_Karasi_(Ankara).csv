country: Turkey.
description: Said to be the first traditional method sparkling wine produced in Turkey, this is made from Kalecik Karasi, an indigenous red grape. It delivers a bouquet of Granny Smith apple, ripe peach and white flowers. These are followed by a strong sense of effervescence and flavors of nectarine, lemon, green apple and rose petal, with the faintest sense of sweetness. It is zesty and alive, culminating in a lingering peach-pie finish..
