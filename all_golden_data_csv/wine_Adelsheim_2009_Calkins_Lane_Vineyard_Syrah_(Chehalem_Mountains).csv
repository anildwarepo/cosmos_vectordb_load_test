country: US.
description: It might seem odd to plant Syrah in the heart of Pinot Noir country, but it's one of the mysterious charms of the Northwest, where Riesling and Cabernet can also grow successfully side by side. This wine has deep color, excellent balance, true varietal expression, and seductive hints of smoke, cured meat, and a salty tang. Purple berry flavors are just ripe enough; it's an elegant, restrained style, suggesting that the Willamette Valley can put a unique stamp on this grape..
