wine_Rubicon_Estate_2006_Red_(Rutherford),"Unnamed: 0: 107992.
country: US.
description: The new Rubicon, which is almost all Cabernet Sauvignon, brings to mind the 2003 and 2004. It doesn't have the sheer force of 2002 or 2005, but it's certainly a classic Rutherford wine, and has a good future. Bone dry, it shows herb-infused flavors of blackberries, cocoa, spices and smoky sandalwood, and yes, the tannins are dusty. Drinkable now, with a good decant, and should develop in the bottle over the next 6â€“8 years..
