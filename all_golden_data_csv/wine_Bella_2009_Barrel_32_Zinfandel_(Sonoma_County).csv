country: US.
description: Bella's quartet of new 2009 Zinfandels is their best ever. This small-production wine, a best-of-barrels selection from their various vineyards, is softly tannic and silky, and its flavors of wild berry, currant, cola, spice and sandalwood should be enjoyed now. The mouthfeel is utterly luxurious, offering the best elements of a Napa Valley cult Cabernet, with the briary, rustically chic qualities of Zinfandel..
