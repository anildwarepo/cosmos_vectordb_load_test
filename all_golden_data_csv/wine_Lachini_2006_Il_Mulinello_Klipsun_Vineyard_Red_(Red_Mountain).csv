wine_Lachini_2006_Il_Mulinello_Klipsun_Vineyard_Red_(Red_Mountain),"Unnamed: 0: 35014.
country: US.
description: This wine has been in release for almost two years, but the extra time has only improved it. Nicely melding the strengths of Klipsun vineyard Cabernet and Merlot with 24 months in half new, half year-old French oak barrels, this powerful wine has concentrated cherry and cassis fruit, potent baking spices, suggestions of mint and pepper, and a host of details waiting to be noticed. A great bottle to toss into a blind tasting of high-end California reds..
