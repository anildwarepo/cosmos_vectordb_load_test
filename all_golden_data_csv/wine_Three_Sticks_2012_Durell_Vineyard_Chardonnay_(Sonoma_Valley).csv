country: US.
description: Consistency of richness and caramel toastiness characterizes this wine year in and year out. This vintage exudes both the full-bodied style embraced by the producer as well as the voluptuously ripe and wholesome fruit that comes off of the vineyard in a year like 2012. Dark gold in color, it offers salty, savory accents around a core of lemon-specked minerality. Surreal and effete, it finishes with flair..
