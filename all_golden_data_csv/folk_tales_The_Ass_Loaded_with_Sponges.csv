title: The Ass Loaded with Sponges.
text: A man, whom I shall call an ass-eteer,His sceptre like some Roman emperor bearing,Drove on two coursers of protracted ear,The one, with sponges laden, briskly faring;The other lifting legsAs if he trod on eggs,With constant need of goading,And bags of salt for loading.O’er hill and dale our merry pilgrims pass’d,Till, coming to a river’s ford at last,They stopp’d quite puzzled on the shore.Our asseteer had cross’d the stream before;So, on the lighter beast astride,He drives the other, spite of dread,Which, loath indeed to go ahead,Into a deep hole turns aside,And, facing right about,Where he went in, comes out;For duckings, two or threeHad power the salt to melt,So that the creature feltHis burden’d shoulders free.The sponger, like a sequent sheep,Pursuing through the water deep,Into the same hole plungesHimself, his rider, and the sponges.All three drank deeply: asseteer and assFor boon companions of their load might pass;Which last became so sore a weight,The ass fell down,Belike to drownHis rider risking equal fate.A helper came, no matter who.The moral needs no more ado—That all can’t act alike,—The point I wish’d to strike..
