Description: Fifteen studies are grouped into three closely related themes identified as 1) textual construction of the professions--the ways in which texts help shape professional perspectives of human experience; 2) the dynamics of discourse communities--the discursive process as a means of enrolling outsiders into an insider's views and commitments; and 3) the dynamics of how texts, originating within specialized discourse communities, can profoundly influence a wide range of social activities.
