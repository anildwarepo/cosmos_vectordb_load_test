country: South Africa.
description: While this is certainly on the higher end of South African Shiraz price points, it's worth the investment. The intense bouquet is loaded with rich dark cherry, raspberry, sweet spice and small wild strawberries. All-spice and pepper dominate the creamy mouth, with opulent flavors of meaty plum, roasted espresso and black cherry guts. Full and powerful in the mouth with a strong vanilla-accented finish. Delicious now but worthy of cellar time as well..
