description: Ripe and tropical, this full-bodied wine conveys mango, quince and ripe white peach that accompany a rich texture. It's going to develop relatively quickly, so drink from 2018. Winemaker Stephan Carrier returned from Napa to take over winemaking after Irish businessman Lochlann Quinn bought the property in 2001. A new winery and barrel cellar opened in 2011. Hubert de Boüard of Château Angelus consults with Carrier. Fieuzal's newsletter is an accurate report on harvests..
