country: US.
description: An absolutely lovely Pinot, the best in Gainey's long career. Dry, smooth and silky, it defines Pinot's more Burgundian side, with mushroomy notes along with perfectly ripe cherries and raspberries, accented with brilliant acidity. The oak treatment is tasteful and blends in seamlessly, offering a hint of toast. The wine treads an exciting line between ripeness and earthiness, while keeping alcohol to a refreshingly low 14.1%. This is a connoisseur's wine..
