country: England.
description: Beautifully delineated fruit constitues the nose, with ripe, yellow plum playing alongside crisp, green apple. The palate layers a sonorous tone of sourdough bread with rich hints of yeast, green-apple briskness and gentle yellow plum. The notions unite with the fizzing, fine mousse. On the midpalate and the finish, the depth of this wine becomes clear: Profound and rich but in a totally slender, unassuming and convincing fashion. The finish is pure and lasting. Drink 2017–2027..
