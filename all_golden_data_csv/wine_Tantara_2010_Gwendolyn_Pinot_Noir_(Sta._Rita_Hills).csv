country: US.
description: Tantara's nine new Pinot Noirs are all fabulous, but the Gwendolyn is their best. It is, in a word, gorgeous. Brisk in acidity, balanced in alcohol and oak, it displays a complex array of flavors, ranging from black cherries and cola to pomegranates, rhubarbs, persimmons and sweet currants. For all the power, it feels as delicate as a rose petal. Drink this lush wine now and over the next 10 years..
