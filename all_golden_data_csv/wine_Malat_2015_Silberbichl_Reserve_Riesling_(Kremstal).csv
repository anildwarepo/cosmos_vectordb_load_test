country: Austria.
description: A subdued nose has the gentle lift of lemon oil and fresh lemon zest. The palate confirms all of this rich freshness, which streams with great direction across the palate. This is taut and concentrated, with a poised freshness and structure that holds very rich lemon and tangy citrus at its core. There is so much drive and direction. The lovely long finish is reminiscent of Seville orange and pink grapefruit..
