country: Austria.
description: Fresh pear and lively yeast, peppery watercress and fresh citrus create a lively, appetizing nose. The palate bristles with wonderfully tingling citrus freshness that highlights all the aromatic aspects in turn: the fruitiness, the ripeness, the savory backdrop of yeast and the light-footed but concentrated core. This is still very young but so ready and utterly irresistible, yet with the mileage to age. Don't drink too quickly—you'll miss the chance of savoring the peppery aftertaste..
