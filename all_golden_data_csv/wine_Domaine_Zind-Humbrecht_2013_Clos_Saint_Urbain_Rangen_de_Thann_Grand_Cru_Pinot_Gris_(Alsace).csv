country: France.
description: Fulsome notes of ripe, juicy pear lead straight to a fluid, concentrated palate that holds a whole world of ripe pear flavors. This is still deep in its shell, ringing with primary fruit but burying many layers of spiced joy: think marzipan and gingerbread. This is one for laying down that will reward patient drinkers. The deep core of fruit, the concentration on the midpalate and the ultraclean finish all suggest a great future. Drink 2018–2028..
