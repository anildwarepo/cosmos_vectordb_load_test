country: US.
description: Planted in the 1970s, the Frank Herbert Vineyard is owned by winemaker Marco Cappelli. Newsome-Harlow winemaker Scott Klann made a great Zin from this vineyard in 2009, but the 2010 seems sweeter, dialed up on a lot of levels, with more intensity of fruit and alcohol and less of the savory spice that was so attractive last vintage. Still, it's worth tasting for the sake of understanding the vicissitudes of vineyard, vintage and vintner..
