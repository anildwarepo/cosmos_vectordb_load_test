country: US.
description: This is the third release of Figgins, a single wine produced by Leonetti's Chris Figgins from his Figgins Estate vineyard. Intensely aromatic, it explodes from the glass with baking spices and deep cassis fruit. Over the course of three days it opened into a sleek, stylish, complex mix of purple- and black-berries, dried herbs, bark, dusty cocoa and a streak of caramel. Long and lush, it's a wine to cellar for a decade or more..
