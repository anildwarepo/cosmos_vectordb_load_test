country: US.
description: This wine comes from three-year-old vines at this esteemed vineyard. Lighter in color, it has aromas that pop and are very primary, with notes of boysenberry, raspberry and herb. Lighter in style, the flavors are pure and direct, showing no new oak influence (neutral barrels for four months) and an appealing feel. The purity is dazzling. It impresses on its own but is meant to be shown at the dinner table..
