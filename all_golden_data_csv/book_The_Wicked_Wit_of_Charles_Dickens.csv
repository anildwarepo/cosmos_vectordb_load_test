Description: A prolific novelist and chronicler of Victorian England, the works of Charles Dickens have inspired, enthralled and entertained millions across the globe. In The World According to Charles Dickens, aspects of the personal life of Britain's greatest writer are revealed and explored, along with the highs and lows of his professional life, covering such subjects as childhood and family, women and love, politics and wealth, marriage and divorce. Born in Portsmouth, in 1812, he spent a happy childhood in Chatham, Kent, until the age of twelve, when his father was imprisoned for debt. After working as an office boy, and studying shorthand, he became a reporter for the Morning Chronicle before writing articles for numerous other periodicals. By 1836, these articles were republished in book form as Sketches by Boz. Dickens then began his career as a novelist, and continued to write until his death in 1870. An entertaining and informative biography, which features extracts and quotes from his works, and draws comparisons between the life and work of one of the world's best-known writers, The World According to Charles Dickens provides a fascinating insight into this great individual. A must for all readers and admirers of Dickens..
