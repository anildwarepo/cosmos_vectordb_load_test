country: US.
description: This Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend is a best-of-barrels selection from Summers' various Cabs throughout Napa Valley. It's unquestionably a big wine, densely packed with blackberry, cherry and dark chocolate flavors. It's also very young. The tannins pack a real punch. New oak, to the tune of 100%, is apparent in the buttered toast richness. Don't drink it now, good as it is. Give it until 2014, and it will develop long beyond that..
