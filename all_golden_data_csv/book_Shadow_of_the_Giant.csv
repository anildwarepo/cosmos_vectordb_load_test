Description: Orson Scott Card's acclaimed new series following the events of his classic, award-winning Ender saga continues. Bean has narrowly averted total disaster and managed to thwart the plans of Achilles. But Achilles is far from defeated and his final goal - total domination of the Earth - is still well within his grasp. Now Bean must bring all his power and intellect to bear if he is to withstand the rise of the Hegemon. But even one of Ender's greatest generals must realise when he is fighting a battle that cannot possibly be won.
