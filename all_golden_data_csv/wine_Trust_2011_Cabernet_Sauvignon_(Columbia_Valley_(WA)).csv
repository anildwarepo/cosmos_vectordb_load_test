country: US.
description: With half of the fruit coming from Kelly Vineyard in The Rocks region of the Walla Walla Valley, this leafy offering of the variety has notes of green herbs, cherry and vanilla. It's dazzling in feel, coating the palate from end to end with velvety soft cherry flavors that linger on the finish. Some may find the aromas too green on this cool-vintage wine but the flavors and feel will make others swoon..
