First Page Reviews: Nice and simple app. it would be a great improvement to include current photos of the landmarks so you could be sure you were reading about the right thing. Also, for the Roman Forum or would be awesome to include reconstructed images, or reconstructed AR view Useful, it worths the money. It should have more info though. Wanted to purchase but no where does it provide a price. Wants you to go thru credit process with no idea of cost. Only free for 5 minutes.
