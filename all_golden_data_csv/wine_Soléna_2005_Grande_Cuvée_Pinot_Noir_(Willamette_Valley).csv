country: US.
description: Kudos to winemaker Laurent Montalieu for holding the line on price. His Soléna Grande Cuvée is one of the four or five best value Pinots in Oregon, if not the entire country. Nine vineyards contribute to the blend, a spicy and herbal mix of rhubarb, pepper, tomato leaf, black raspberry, currant and rose hips. The flavors and scents are detailed and nicely consolidated into a complex and harmonious wine. It will open up nicely with a couple of hours in a decanter..
