Description: (Selected excerpts and outside reviews can be found by clicking on the blue Python Bonkers hyperlink.) This book may share an alphabetical lineage with the Frey book, but there is no melodramatic redemption here -- it is not a parody of that book but its own entity. As one of the characters from the book says, We're still involved in the commission of the acts that will require redemption -- and those stories are always so much more fun. Bonkers and his bizarre team embarks on a gonzo tear through the streets of Los Angeles and across the pop cultural landscape as well. In his satirical quest for truth in journalism, and life, he must navigate through the many odd tiers of social class, in both the Southern California culture and in his Machiavellian office life and its absurd red and blue political divisions. This is no heart-wrenching tale of excess, its destination is hilarity, so it presses the pedal to the metal and takes no prisoners..
