country: Austria.
description: This wine pulls off a daring feat: despite palate weight and concentration it has a light, almost delicate, feathery citrus touch and a streamlined, fresh palate. The aromatic expression is just beginning to unfold, promising freshly cut apples and oceans of green and dried spice. This should carry a danger-warning: seriously, deliciously addictive! Beautiful now but it deserves maturing. Drink as of 2016–2017..
