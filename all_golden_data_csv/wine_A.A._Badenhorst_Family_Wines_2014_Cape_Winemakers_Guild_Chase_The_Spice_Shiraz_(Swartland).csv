description: Winemaker: Adi Badenhorst. There's a distinct earthy, gamy funk to the nose of this wine, showcased in scents of woodland berries, cured meat, tree bark and damp leaves. It's supported by a core of ripe wild strawberry, raspberry and boysenberry, which flesh out the smooth, medium-weight palate. The tannins are gripping, yet well-integrated with the fruit, giving a pleasant grip and texture to the long, spicy finish. It's enjoyable now, but should continue to gain interest and complexity through 2023..
