wine_Muhr-Van_der_Niepoort_2012_Samt_&_Seide_Blaufränkisch_(Carnuntum),"Unnamed: 0: 10724.
country: Austria.
description: This is as tightly closed as a new rosebud, but suspicions of iron oxide and red cherry escape. On the palate this has a northerly, cool aspect and its very own, reticent charm. More iron oxide comes to the fore, along with earthiness and a mix of elderberry and red cherry. If you have the patience to wait until 2017–2018, this will come to you as a grown-up beauty. Its name Samt & Seide—velvet & silk—does it justice indeed..
