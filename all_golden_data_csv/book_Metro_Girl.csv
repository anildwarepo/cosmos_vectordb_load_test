Description: Alexandra (Barney) Barnaby roars onto the Miami Beach scene in hot pursuit of her missing baby brother, ""Wild"" Bill. Leave it to the maverick of the family to get Barney involved with high-speed car chases, a search for sunken treasure, and Sam Hooker, a NASCAR driver whoâ€™s good at revving a woman's engine. Engaged in a deadly race, Bill has ""borrowed"" Hooker's sixty-five-foot Hatteras and sailed off into the sunset...just when Hooker has plans for the boat. Hooker figures he'll attach himself to Barney and maybe run into scumbag Bill. And better yet, maybe he'll get lucky in love with Bill's sweetie pie sister. The pedal will have to go to metal if Barney and Hooker want to be the first to cross the finish line, save Bill, Hooker's boat...and maybe the world..
