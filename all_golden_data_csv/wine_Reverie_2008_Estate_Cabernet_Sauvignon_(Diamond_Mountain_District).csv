country: US.
description: Impressive for the volume of its flavor, which is all intensely concentrated mountain blackberries and cassis, with an interesting and savory salty earthiness of green olives. Beautifully oaked, too, so sweet and refined in toast. But those notorious Diamond Mountain tannins are gigantic, and the wine needs serious cellar time. Stash until 2014, and the drinkabiity window could last for an additional ten years..
