country: Australia.
description: Worth the effort to find, this wine shows terrific balance in every respect. Subtle oak and spice frame ripe cherry fruit on the nose. Refreshing herb and spice elements add zest to cherry and cola flavors on the palate, where the wine is fleshy without being at all heavy. The ripe tannins on the finish are supple enough to make this approachable now, but it should also evolve gracefully for at least five-to-eight years..
