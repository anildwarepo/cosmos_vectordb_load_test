wine_Syzygy_2004_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 105196.
country: US.
description: This is pure Cabernet from older vines, and has a meaty, herbal power to it. Streaks of tar and some lively cinnamon spice add life to the fruit, which is solid and earthy. I pick up black licorice, vanilla cream, and still more interesting flavors wrapped into the tannins, which seem dusty and smoky and a bit grainy. This has some real substance to it, and shows some of the herbal side of the grape. The best so far from SYZYGY..
