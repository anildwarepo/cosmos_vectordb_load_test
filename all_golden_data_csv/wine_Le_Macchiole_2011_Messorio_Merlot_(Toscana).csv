country: Italy.
description: Made entirely with Merlot, this full-bodied wine opens with aromas of ripe berry, coffee, vanilla, exotic spice and a whiff of grilled herb. The concentrated palate doles out fleshy black cherries, juicy raspberries licorice, chocolate and tobacco, while velvety tannins provide the framework. A note of dried sage closes the finish. It's already approachable but will continue to age well for several years or more. Drink through 2023..
