country: France.
description: Perhaps better known for his Côte-Rôties, Pierre Gaillard is obviously comfortable working with schist. Transhumance is an intense and complex wine, with assertive notes of kirsch, sweet smoke, wild game and garrigue accents of thyme, rosemary and violet. Rich and lush in the mouth, the texture is like crushed velvet and the finish evolves from a dark fruit blast to sweet vanilla bean and finally ending on a smoked cedar and spice note..
