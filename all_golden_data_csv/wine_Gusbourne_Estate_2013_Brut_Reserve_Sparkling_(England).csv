country: England.
description: A generously ripe touch of apricot hovers before blending in with ripe Amalfi lemon and Granny Smith notes. Brightness and light seem to be at the core of this wine. The mousse is exuberant and flavors are brisk and urgent. Subtle autolysis provides a calm backdrop to all the lively, fruity action in the foreground. The balance is harmonious and flavors are brisk, fruity and pure The long-lasting finish conveys seriousness. Lovely now, the wine will evolve with bottle age. Drink 2017–2022..
