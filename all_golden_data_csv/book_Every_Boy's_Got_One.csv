What Jane doesn't gamble on is Mark's choice for best man, journalist Cal Langdon. It's hate at first sight for Jane and Cal. But when Holly and Mark's wedding plans hit a major snag that only Jane and Cal can repair, the two find themselves having to put aside their mutual dislike for one another in order to get their best friends on the road to wedded bliss - and end up on a path neither of them ever expected to tread. . .
