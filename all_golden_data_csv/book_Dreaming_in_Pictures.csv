Description: ""Lewis Carroll was the pen name of the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, the author of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and other beloved children's books. But before achieving fame as an author, Dodgson was a prolific and sophisticated photographer, acutely engaged in the art world of Victorian England. This beautifully illustrated book is the first to examine Dodgson's photographs not as the sideline of a celebrated writer, but as the creations of a serious photographic artist - and to demonstrate their importance to the history of photography."" ""Dreaming in Pictures: The Photography of Lewis Carroll is published in conjunction with an exhibition organized by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and traveling to the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the International Center for Photography in New York, and the Art Institute of Chicago.""--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.
