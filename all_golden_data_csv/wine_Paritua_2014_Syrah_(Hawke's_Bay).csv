country: New Zealand.
description: This plush, silky wine is a thrill ride from start to finish. Asphalt and black olive notes on the nose give it a rather rustic edge to start, but purer peppery notes emerge with air. And once past the funk, this shows layers of blueberry and mulberry fruit, maybe even a trace of apricot to go along with savory notes of olive and espresso that glide gracefully through the long, silky finish. Drink nowâ€“2025..
