country: US.
description: Once again the Spofford Station fruit shines; this is muscular, fully ripe, textural and dense with a seamless mix of red, blue and black fruits that sails effortlessly into the ripe tannins. The underpinning of firm acid and the hints of dill-flavored spice (from a percentage of American oak) serve to expand the wine in the mouth, adding breadth and depth. It finishes a bit chalky and sour, but otherwise has a lot of positives..
