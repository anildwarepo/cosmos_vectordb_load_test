country: US.
description: The vineyard isn't well known, but it's on Pritchard Hill, near much more famous sources of Cabernet. It's a deceptive wine, so rich and flamboyant in sweet, jammy blackberries and cherries, chocolate and licorice, you want to drink the whole bottle. Yet it has the tannin-acid balance to age, possibly for a long time. Made from 100% Cab, yet produced in tiny quantities, it shows the Pritchard signature of youthful deliciousness combined with ageability..
