country: US.
description: Piña has a spectacular record with this wine, and indeed with all their Cabs from Howell Mountain. The '07 is notable for its superb structure. It has pristine tannins and a good, dry mouthfeel, with very rich flavors of blackberries, currants, chocolate and cedar that are grounded with notes of anise and sweet herbs. Very fine and dramatic, this 100% Cab should develop for at least the next eight years..
