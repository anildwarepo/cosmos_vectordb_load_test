country: Australia.
description: As unevolved as they are, the dense and multilayered aromas and flavors are truly impressive here. Black currant, herb, tea, oak, vanilla, maple, anise, blueberries and more--it could be an excercise in overkill, if all the parts weren't in such fine harmony. Really big, but with excellent balance, this reveals much less now than the RWT. It is everything a flagship wine in its infancy should be--immaculate component parts, superbly full on the palate, possessed of great length and incredible potential. An absolute keeper to visit in 7, 15 or 25 years. To be released 5/01..
