country: Austria.
description: Cherry and pepper are the hallmarks of Zweigelt. Here, they are very aromatic: While muted on the nose, the palate is fresh, lively and very authentic. Merlot adds riper fruit while Blaufränkisch contributes more pepper and structure. This is a very harmonious blend. Lovely now but with the mileage to last a number of years in the cellar. Aromatic cherry fruit echoes on the palate. Drink now until 2020..
