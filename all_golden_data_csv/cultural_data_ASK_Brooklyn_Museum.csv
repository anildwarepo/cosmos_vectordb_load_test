I'm even excited to return to the museum just to get to use the app. I had a question about a photograph title that was keeping me from paying full attention to the photo itself. The curator's answer caused me to look once again and more closely. That second look cleared my question and then I was able to view the photo without puzzlement, and as a result, I saw more of what the photographer was trying to convey. I'm hooked! I like the idea.

This could potentially be improved if there were some partially automated responses, particularly when doing a scavenger hunt. Kids tend to lose interest when waiting for responses from historians during times when there is an increased demand on the historians attention. It's like having. Professional museum guide. you can ask anything - general or specific - and get a great answer - and get a follow-up if you need more info. Response time very quick - and the answer is there on your phone. This a great service! Great app for when you're in a museum and would like to know more about specific pieces. Fast response and easy to use..
