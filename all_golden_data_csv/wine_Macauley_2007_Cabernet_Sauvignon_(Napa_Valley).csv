country: US.
description: A stunningly good Cabernet. Just dazzling in sheer delicious fruit, yet wonderfully structured. So smooth and velvety, flooding the mouth with layers of blackberries, black cherries, cassis, chocolate, mint, spice and toast. The tannins are thrilling, being firm and soft at the same time. The vineyard sourcing was Star, in Rutherford, and Stagecoach, on Atlas Peak, with a few drops from Beckstoffer To Kalon. Very great now, and should develop over the next 10 years..
