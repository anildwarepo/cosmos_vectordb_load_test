country: France.
description: This is named for Arnaud Puyanché, who moved to Francs to make wine but put the project on hold due to the Great War of 1914. Five generations later, the family has revived his dream of producing estate wines. Ripe and full of red fruits, this 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc is concentrated and rich. The tannins are fine and already integrated into the fruits. With the acidity at the end, this is a well-balanced wine with a good future. Drink from 2020..
