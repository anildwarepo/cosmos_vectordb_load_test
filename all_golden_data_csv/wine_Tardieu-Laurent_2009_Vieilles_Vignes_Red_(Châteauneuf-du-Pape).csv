wine_Tardieu-Laurent_2009_Vieilles_Vignes_Red_(Châteauneuf-du-Pape),"Unnamed: 0: 13526.
country: France.
description: This is a rugged, firmly tannic rendering of Châteauneuf-du-Pape that requires time in the cellar to reach its full potential. That said, it may also pose a risk, because there are hints of Band-Aid on the nose and a slightly metallic edge to the finish that may worsen over time. The other flavors are potent and concentrated: plum, chocolate and licorice all leave lasting impressions on the palate. Try after 2016..
