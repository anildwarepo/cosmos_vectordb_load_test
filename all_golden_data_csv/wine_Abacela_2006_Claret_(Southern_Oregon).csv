wine_Abacela_2006_Claret_(Southern_Oregon),"Unnamed: 0: 5150.
country: US.
description: Two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, with the other Bordeaux grapes filling in the rest. Though this 2006 vintage was held back for some time to allow for extra bottle age, this is still a hard, tannic wine that requires decanting. The build-out is well done, tannins firm and moderately ripe, fruit flavors Bordeaux-like. Right now it's a bit monolithic, tasty enough, but without the textural interest that most Abacela wines display..
