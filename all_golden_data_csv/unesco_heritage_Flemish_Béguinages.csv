unesco_heritage_Flemish_Béguinages,"Name: Flemish Béguinages.
short_description: <p>The <em>Béguines</em> were women who dedicated their lives to God without retiring from the world. In the 13th century they founded the <em>béguinages</em> , enclosed communities designed to meet their spiritual and material needs. The Flemish <em>béguinages</em> are architectural ensembles composed of houses, churches, ancillary buildings and green spaces, with a layout of either urban or rural origin and built in styles specific to the Flemish cultural region. They are a fascinating reminder of the tradition of the <em>Béguines</em> that developed in north-western Europe in the Middle Ages.</p>.
