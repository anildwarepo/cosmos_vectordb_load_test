wine_Cavallotto_2014_Nebbiolo_(Langhe),"Unnamed: 0: 40780.
country: Italy.
description: Cavallotto didn't make any Barolo in the 2014 vintage due to the cold rainy weather so the firm's best grapes went into this vibrant polished Nebbiolo. It opens with enticing scents of rose, perfumed berry, chopped herb and a whiff of tilled soil that follow through to the racy medium-bodied palate along with crushed raspberry, cherry, star anise and mineral. It's nicely balanced, with firm acidity and taut refined tannins. Drink through 2020..
