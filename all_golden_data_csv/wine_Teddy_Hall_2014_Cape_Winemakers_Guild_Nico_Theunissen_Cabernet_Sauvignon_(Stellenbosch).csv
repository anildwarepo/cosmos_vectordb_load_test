country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Teddy Hall. This is a rich and opulent Cab, with upfront aromas of vanilla, sweet oak spice, cherry preserves and raspberry compote that seduce you into the glass. You'd expect the palate to be slick and heavy, and it is quite soft in ripe fruit flavors, but it's just structured enough, thanks to velvety tannins and lingering spice on the medium-length finish. Given the judicious oak and plush flavors and feel, enjoy this over the short term..
