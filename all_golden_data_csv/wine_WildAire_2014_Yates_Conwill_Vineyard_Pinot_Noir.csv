country: US.
description: This vineyard, often featured in the Sineann lineup, moves over to WildAire for this sensational debut. The blend is a two-clone mix of 777 and Pommard, and it captures a range of delicate, well-defined flavors. Raspberry, cherry, light char, smoke, pepper, bitter herb, vanilla and camomile tea come rolling through. The prime location, which borders on Jadot's Résonance vineyard, contributes a great deal, but the winemaking brings it on home..
