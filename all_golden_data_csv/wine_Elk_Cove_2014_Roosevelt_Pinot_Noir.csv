wine_Elk_Cove_2014_Roosevelt_Pinot_Noir,"Unnamed: 0: 46871.
country: US.
description: From the first sniff to the last sip, this sensational effort seduces, with deep, rich, slightly roasted flavors of dense black fruits. The black cherry core is so intense it veers into cassis, with veins of espresso, Kahlúa and cacao. It's a powerful wine, perfectly framed and balanced by ripe tannins. It's ready to drink now, but certainly a wine you may confidently cellar for at least another decade..
