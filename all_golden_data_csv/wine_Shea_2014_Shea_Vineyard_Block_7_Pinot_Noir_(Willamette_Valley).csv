description: It's no exaggeration to say that the 2014 releases from Shea are the best (as an entire group) in the winery's history. Could be maturing of the vines, along with a textbook perfect vintage, but whatever the reasons, these wines are not to be missed. Floral highlights, potent ripe cherry fruit, a dusting of cocoa powder and myriad layers come together in this irresistible, impeccably balanced block selection..
