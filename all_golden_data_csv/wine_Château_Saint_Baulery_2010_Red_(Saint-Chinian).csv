wine_Château_Saint_Baulery_2010_Red_(Saint-Chinian),"Unnamed: 0: 39481.
country: France.
description: The nose is loaded with mineral, pencil lead and blackberry notes. Generously juicy on the palate, this exudes youthful fruit backed by terroir-influenced notes. The tannins are structured and lightly sinewy yet soft all at once. The acidity is fresh, carrying the well-concentrated flavors of this chunky wine into a medium finish. This is a decidedly Old World in style, with evident fruit purity and provenance of place. Drink now and for three more years..
