country: US.
description: The mystery of how to make a Chardonnay, is solved with this wine; fruity, rich and creamy, yet one that finishes so dry and crisp in acidity. Who else holds back a Chardonnay five years except Jim Clendenen? Low in alcohol and balanced despite being aged in 100% new French oak, it's just now beginning a long journey of excellence. It has a soft, lilting mouthfeel and incredible complexity that will only improve with time..
