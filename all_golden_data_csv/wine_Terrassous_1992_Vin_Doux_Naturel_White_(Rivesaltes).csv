country: France.
description: This lush and powerful selection opens with intense aromas of candied walnuts, orange rind, peanut brittle, dried apricot and vanilla-soaked oak. Round and plush in feel, it boasts a silky texture and decadent notes of apricot syrup, ginger-peach tea, clove-spiked orange and wood spice that are kept in check by ample acidity. A lovely pour that is delicious now yet will continue to hold well for another decade..
