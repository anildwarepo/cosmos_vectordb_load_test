description: The price hasn't been set yet on this wine, which will be released in November, but the '04 was $275. This 100% Cabernet is stunning, a quintessential hillside Cab that's powerful and compelling in blackberries, red and black currants, cola, spices and cedar. It feels ultra-refined in the mouth, with slightly tough tannins and a trace of acidity giving a sturdy structure. Decant this great wine if you open it now, and it should evolve for a good 15 years in the cellar..
