country: US.
description: The second vintage of Steven Kent's lovely, lofty Lineage, impressive in its Kingly bottle, is as ambitious as last year's, a sumptious blend of 81% Cabernet Sauvignon (three different clones), 9% Cabernet Franc, 5% Petit Verdot, 3% Malbec and 2% Merlot. Its red fruit is prominent, the wine high-toned, succulent with cherry and pomegranate. Integrated and appropriately weighty, it lifts even higher on the coffee-laced finish. Give it a few years more in bottle and wow..
