country: US.
description: A powerful, concentrated Cabernet Sauvignon. Impressive for the sheer density of fruit, namely blackberries, cherries and chocolate, accented with buttery, caramelized new oak perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume. The tannins are soft, sweet and intricate. Despite the richness, There's a firm minerality that adds to the structure and grounds it. So opulently delicious, you could drink it now, and it should develop in the bottle over the next six years, at least..
