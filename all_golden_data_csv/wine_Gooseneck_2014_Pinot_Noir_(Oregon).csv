country: US.
description: Gooseneck is based in Rhode Island but sources wines from around the world. This Pinot was produced at River's Edge, in the Elkton Oregon AVA. It sends out aromas of caramel and graham cracker, and enters the palate with a soft, silky mouthfeel and plum fruit. Though the vintage is recent, it drinks like a more mature wine, with granular tannins and flavors of coffee grounds running through the finish..
