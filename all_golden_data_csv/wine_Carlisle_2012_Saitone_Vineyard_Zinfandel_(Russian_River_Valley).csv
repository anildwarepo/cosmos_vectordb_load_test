description: Interplanted to Carignane, Alicante Bouschet and Grand Noir, this Zin vineyard hails back to 1895, a grande dame in the region, and is farmed by Ulises Valdez. The meticulous farming and winemaking are in full view, the wine velvety in blueberry and boysenberry fruit, while well-honed tannins and a full body announce its presence. On the finish is a satisfying streak of black licorice and pepper. Cellar through 2022..
