country: France.
description: There can't be many, if any, other 100% Pinot Blanc Champagnes. Allowed in the appellation, the grape is only really found in this southern Aube region. It comes to the fore with Aur√©lien Gerbais (fourth generation), produced from vines planted in 1904. This wine is a soft, creamy and immediately drinkable, with ripe apple and pear flavors. It would repay a few months more in bottle; drink from 2017..
