I was hoping the app  offered a virtual tour or at least a more extensive catalog of items with  photos and information. I wanted to relive my great experience.  Unfortunately, there aren't many items listed and, while the thumbnail  photos look great, the larger photos are all slightly out of focus. It's  really disappointing to not see the items in their full detail and beauty.  This app has potential but it needs a lot more work and some quality  control. really i like how amazing it is, it carries out a lot of information about the museum collection, some PDF's for some manuscripts are downloadable throw the app, Arabic and English interface, and the application is really well designed. Great application, should be downloaded to know more about Muslim history..
