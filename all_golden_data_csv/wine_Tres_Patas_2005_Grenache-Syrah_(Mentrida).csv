country: Spain.
description: MÃ©ntrida is an island wine region in the middle of central Spain, and this blend of Garnacha and Syrah is lively, juicy and delicious. The nose is deep and luscious, with mounds of cassis and blackberry. The spunky palate shows big tannins but plenty of offsetting fruit and pulp. Finishing notes of chocolate and pepper leave a positive lasting impression. Should age for several more years; 400 cases produced..
