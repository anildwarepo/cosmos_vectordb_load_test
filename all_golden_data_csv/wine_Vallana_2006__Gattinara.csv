wine_Vallana_2006__Gattinara,"Unnamed: 0: 109464.
country: Italy.
description: Alpine herb, underbrush, pressed rose petal, dried berry and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find in this elegant Nebbiolo. It's still remarkably youthful, with bright red cherry, fresh raspberry, clove, white pepper and mineral flavors accented by notes of rosemary and sage. It's impeccably balanced, with tightly wound but fine-grained tannins and bright acidity that support the bright flavors and vibrant edge. Drink 2018–2031..
