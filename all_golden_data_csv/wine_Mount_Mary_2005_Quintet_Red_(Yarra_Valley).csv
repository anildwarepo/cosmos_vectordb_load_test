country: Australia.
description: An icon in Australia, Mount Mary has never made a huge splash here in the States. Perhaps because such miniscule quantities are available (30 cases of the 2005 Quintet). The 2005 Quintet presents as a medium-bodied, nicely rounded Bordeaux-style blend, marrying cedary, meaty notes with cherry fruit and graced with touches of cinnamon and mushroom. It's nicely balanced and reasonably complex; ready to drink now..
