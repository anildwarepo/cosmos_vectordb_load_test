country: Italy.
description: Scorched earth, ripe berry, underbrush, ground pepper, leather and a balsamic note are just some of the aromas you'll find on this superb Barolo. The young, tight palate delivers rich black cherry, baking spice, licorice and tobacco while firm, velvety tannins provide the framework. A mineral vein energizes the finish. It already shows a great depth of flavors but it's still young and assertive. Hold to let this unwind and develop complexity. Drink 2021–2031..
