wine_Del_Rio_2005_Claret_Red_(Rogue_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 116502.
country: US.
description: This is a true Claret, in that the blend includes 41% Merlot, 36% Cabernet Franc, 14% Cabernet Sauvignon, and 9% Malbec. It is lushly scented with licorice, tobacco, clove, some plastic and dark fruits, especially black cherry. The fruit and indeed the wine itself has been softened to the point of losing its focus; perhaps an effort to subdue the vineyard's notorious tannins. This is forward and pleasant but a bit diffuse..
