country: US.
description: A gorgeous mélange of botrytized Riesling and Chardonnay, every sip of this honey-kissed wine is an explosion of blossom and fruit. It's intensely concentrated, rippling with tropical tones of mango, melon and pineapple, yet featherlight on the palate. The finish is languorous, alternating sweet layers of honey and marmalade marked by hints of salt and crushed mineral. Delicious now but should only improve with age, well beyond 2025..
