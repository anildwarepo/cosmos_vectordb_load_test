description: If you must open this now, let it breath for a while because it’s dumb, as they say, on opening. Airing and swirling reveal more earthy things than fruit. There’s a hint of truffles, of bark, and you almost have to close your eyes to imagine the blackberries and cherries buried deep down inside, but they’re there. You can taste them in the midpalate, and the finish lasts for a long time. Cellar this beauty and drink the regular Mondavi Pinot now and for the next five years..
