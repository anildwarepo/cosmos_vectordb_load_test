country: France.
description: Ripe notions of juicy peach and yellow pear rise from the glass. Around the edges they have an aromatic touch of grapefruit zest. That zesty notion remains a constant fixture on the very rich medium-sweet palate, countering the luscious richness of the fruit which shines with honeyed peach, juicy pear and ripe tangerine. It is the zestiness that frames everything on this rich powerful palate. This is lovely now but it has all the fruit and concentration to age well. Drink 2017–2037..
