country: US.
description: Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon share top billing here, in a sleek, stylish, beautifully polished wine loaded with blackberries, black cherries and cassis. Firm and textural, it layers in subtle spices, dark chocolate, espresso and moist loam, all in delicate balance. The firmness of the tannins and tightness of the layering suggests that laying it down for a few years will only improve it further..
