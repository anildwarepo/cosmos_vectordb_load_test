country: Italy.
description: Focused and fragrant, this beautiful expression of the vintage opens with scents of violet, rose, perfumed berry and a hint of cake spice. The silky, linear palate doles out juicy red cherry, chopped aromatic herb, cinnamon and star anise alongside polished tannins and fresh acidity. Balanced and approachable, it will provide sheer drinking pleasure over the next several years or more. Drink 2017–2024..
