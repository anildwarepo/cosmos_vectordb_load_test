country: US.
description: Distinctive and precise, this well-priced wine should have a place in your cellar. It captures the specific characteristics—terroir if you will—that distinguish the best Willamette Valley Pinot Noirs: highlights of cola and herb, refreshing minerality, a perfect balance of fruit, acid and tannin, and a riveting liveliness in the mouth. All this without any hint of new oak makes this a winemaking tour de force..
