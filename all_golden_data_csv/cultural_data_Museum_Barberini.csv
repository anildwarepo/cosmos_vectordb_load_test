First Page Reviews: Audioguides are always made so, that they are interesting both for children and grownups. What's uncomfortable about the app is that there is no option of choosing the language inside the app, you have to switch your phone's language settings. Excellent complement to the exhibition. I can't change the language in the app. I don't want it oversetted into English, want the original. Does what it's supposed to do.
