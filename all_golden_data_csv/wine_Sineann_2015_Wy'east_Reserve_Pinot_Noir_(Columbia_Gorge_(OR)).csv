wine_Sineann_2015_Wy'east_Reserve_Pinot_Noir_(Columbia_Gorge_(OR)),"Unnamed: 0: 78797.
country: US.
description: The reserve is bottled only in 375-ml bottles, and in extremely limited quantities. The extra ripeness is evident in both the alcohol content and the overall mouthfeel. For some tasters it will push this ahead of the regular Wy'east, though some detail is sacrificed along the way. Dense, almost chunky, it brings big bites of chocolate and nougat along with solid flavors of cherry cola. Drink now through 2020..
