country: France.
description: Glorious apple freshness jumps from the glass, there is the slightest touch of honey, too. On the palate, the apple notions persist: there is fresh and baked apple, adding both crisp and mellow notes. Everything is brightened by lemony freshness on a concentrated but elegant and balanced body. Flavors last and have a long, clean and bone-dry finish. This is good enough to go the mileage. Drink now through 2030..
