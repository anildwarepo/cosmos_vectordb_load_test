country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Sebastian Beaumont. Initial aromas of barely ripe honeydew, green plum and lime pith are assertively laced with hints of fynbos and salinity on the nose. The palate is fresh and zingy, with green plum, apple and citrus fruit flavors that persist through the finish. A nice evolution unfolds on the close, transitioning from lively green fruits to citrus peel and finally ending on a subtle oaky-spice accent. It's young and nervy now, but should show more nuance and elegance with time; enjoy the ride through 2021..
