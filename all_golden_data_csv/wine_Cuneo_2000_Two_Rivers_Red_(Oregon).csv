wine_Cuneo_2000_Two_Rivers_Red_(Oregon),"Unnamed: 0: 25647.
country: US.
description: Inky and dense, with plum-cake aromas along with nuances of tree bark and nutmeg. The more time you give this ripe, tannic red, the more it'll offer. The fruit is pure and ripe, and the tannins are anything but meek. On the finish, root beer, chocolate and vanilla notes add some complexity and sweetness. The fruit is 61% Columbia Valley (Wash.) and 39% southern Oregon, and the whole is a fine yet brawny offering..
