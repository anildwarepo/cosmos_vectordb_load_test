country: US.
description: Equipo means team in Spanish, and this blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Petit Verdot and 15% Cabernet Franc is handled from ground to glass by the labor crew that's worked for Grassini since the estate was founded. They know what they're doing, as this is delicious and complex, with blackberry, black currant, bittersweet chocolate and licorice on the nose. The palate packs black plum, black cherry and charred meat with a cocoa finish..
