country: US.
description: This pure Syrah from Reininger's estate vineyard has the focus and also the tightness that often characterize single-vineyard wines. There are dense flavors of cranberry and pomegranate, plenty of natural acid, along with polished tannins and a soothing layer of toasty oak, that helps smooth the rough edges and buff up the finish. Hints of earth, leaf and tar add detail and interest all the way through a lingering finish..
