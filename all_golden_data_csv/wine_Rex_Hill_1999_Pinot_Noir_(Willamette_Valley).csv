wine_Rex_Hill_1999_Pinot_Noir_(Willamette_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 86567.
country: US.
description: A perplexing wine that should be better than it is. It's fairly dense and concentrated, with good depth of flavor. Beets, tomatoes, blackberries, sugared espresso and a myriad of crushed, dusty oriental spices fill the mouth. It's good and dry, with crisp acids and easy tannins. So what's the problem? It just lacks that extra kick. Maybe Rex Hill is diverting the best fruit to their three expensive Pinots..
