country: US.
description: All varietal, this wine is mostly Klipsun and Bacchus vineyards, with Kiona and Red Willow rounding it out. The aromas bring immediate appeal, with pure notes of black cherry, fresh and dried savory herbs and crushed granite, showing pleasing complexities. The palate is tightly wound, showing a fine sense of depth that is balanced by bright acid and firm tannins. The finish lingers. It's a compelling example of the variety..
