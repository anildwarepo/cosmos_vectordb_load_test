country: France.
description: Not quite as big as the BÃ¢tard, Latour's Corton-Charlie is the house's flagship (the company owns 10 hectares of the grand cru) and most ageable wine. The 2000 boasts aromas of gunflint, pear, smoked meat and buttered toast. White peaches emerge on the palate, but the primary flavors are of minerals and spice. Finishes with tons of citrus and an almost tannic feel. Give it two or three years to begin to soften..
