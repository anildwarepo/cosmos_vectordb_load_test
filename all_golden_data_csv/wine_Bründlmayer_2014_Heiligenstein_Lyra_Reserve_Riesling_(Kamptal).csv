country: Austria.
description: Right now, this feels like a compact parcel of closely packed fruit flavors, held tight by citric freshness and yet it offering glimpses of what is to come: there is a hint of yeasty savor, but also a textural element reminiscent of apple peel. The citrus notions are promises of tart grapefruit, tangy orange, ripe tangerine and the purest lemon. There is something definite and astute that stands with an absolutely straight backbone, just waiting for its time to arrive. It will be spectacular. Drink from 2019..
