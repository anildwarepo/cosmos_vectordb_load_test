country: US.
description: It's not just the fruit, which is immaculately ripe in blackberries and black currants. The wine also stands out for the richness of the oak, so perfectly integrated, and the overall balance. Beautiful acidity and thick, rich, supple tannins come along with a gorgeous, long, dry finish. The vineyard is in Yountville. You'll want to cellar this 100% Cab until at least 2020, and it could be going strong longer..
