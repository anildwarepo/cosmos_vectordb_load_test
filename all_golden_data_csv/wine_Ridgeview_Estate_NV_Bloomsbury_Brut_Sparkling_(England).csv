country: England.
description: This wine brims with fruit and freshness. A host of apple notions comes alive on nose and palate: The appetizing, ripe tartness of Cox Orange Pippin, the mouthwatering crispness of Granny Smith and the mellowness of Golden Delicous. It has a refreshing, open honesty, juicy and totally inviting. Underneath all that allure lies rich autolysis, underlined by a fine, creamy mousse. Flavors and freshness linger..
