Description: An attractive new edition of two of Chomsky's most popular books on language - an ideal introduction to his pioneering work in modern linguistics. In Part I, Language and Responsibility, the legend discusses his political, moral and linguistic thinking via a series of interviews with French linguist Mitsou Ronat. In Part II, Reflections on Language, he explores the more general implications of his linguistic theories and the controversies among social scientists over fundamental questions of language..
