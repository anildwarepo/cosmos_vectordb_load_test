country: France.
description: Warming aromatic notes of fresh and dried peach reach the nose. The palate revels in the peachy sweetness, adding a lovely, pleasantly bitter phenolic edge. The flavors are concentrated and have both a welcome tangy zesty edge and some honeyed spice. There is quite a bit of palpable warmth. This is full on and exploding with peachy fruit. The medium-sweet finish is long and warming. Drink 2017–2027..
