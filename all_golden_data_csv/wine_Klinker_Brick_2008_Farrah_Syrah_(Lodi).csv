country: US.
description: From a producer to watch in underrated Lodi, this intense, black cherry, bacon-fat and white peppery Syrah has an almost peat-like, whisky aroma at first, very inviting, which then leads into more bacon and pepper that carries through on the palate, balanced by extremely smooth tannins and an unexpected elegance. A really cool Syrah to try on its own that'll go very nicely with meaty, wintery foods..
