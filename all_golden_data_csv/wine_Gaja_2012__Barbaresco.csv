wine_Gaja_2012__Barbaresco,"Unnamed: 0: 76403.
country: Italy.
description: In 2012, Gaja didn't bottle his single-vineyard crus because they didn't reach his high quality standards, and many of the grapes from these celebrated vineyards finished in this elegant, firmly structured wine. It opens with enticing aromas of perfumed berry, pressed violet and sweet baking spice. On the palate, a backbone of tightly woven but refined tannins support black cherry, raspberry, white pepper, anise and tobacco. It's rather austere and still in its infancy so give it time to fully develop. Drink 2018–2032..
