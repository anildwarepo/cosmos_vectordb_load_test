country: US.
description: Just one barrel was produced from this nine-acre site in the heart of the AVA. This is picture perfect, refined and textural, with flavors that roll from rose petals to strawberries to Bing cherries. A well-framed touch of oak (noted as neutral, yet detectable) contributes to an elongated finish that begs for the next glass. Still young and compact, this should drink its best from 2018 through 2028..
