country: US.
description: Certainly one of the best wines made in the Hudson River region, this richly composed Cabernet Franc juxtaposes zesty cranberry and pomegranate against a velvety, supple palate full of summery black plums and cherries. Touches of savory olive and green pepper lend complexity and nuance. The finish is long, framed by persistent yet fine-grained tannins. Drinks well now but should hold well till 2020..
