country: Croatia.
description: There's so much nuance and complexity in this rustic yet fascinating Croatian wine, that it takes a while to break down its components. Initial scents of dried leaves and mulch blow off to reveal an array of delicate floral and fruit aromas, accented by rich chocolate and vanilla notes. Big in both alcohol and structure, its massively tannic, but smoothes out with aeration. Decant to drink now, but could easily evolve for 5â€“10 years..
