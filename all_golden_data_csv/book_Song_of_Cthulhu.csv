Description: At the heart of the universe, the court of the blind idiot god Azathoth dances to the insane piping of demonic flute-players. The sinister music resounds across space and time, blasting the minds and ripping the souls of those who hear it. It is the melody of chaos, the sound of madness, the song of Cthulhu. This book includes nineteen stories and one essay, linked together by the alien and terrible music of the spheres..
