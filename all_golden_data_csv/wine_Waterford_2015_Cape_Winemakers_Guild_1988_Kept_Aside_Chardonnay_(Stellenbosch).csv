country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Kevin Arnold. There's a lovely oaky lushness throughout this wine, though it's not overdone and it's appropriately balanced by notes of yellow apple, pear, pressed flower and a touch of baking spice, as well as a vibrant seam of citrusy acidity. The palate offers more ripe fruit flavors, with a mineral edge and a lingering, soft spice accent on the finish. It's certainly delicious now, though this will age gracefully through 2021..
