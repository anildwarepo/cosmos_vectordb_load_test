country: US.
description: A barrel-fermented white Pinot Noir, this is bursting with broad, creamy flavors of ripe caramel-dipped apples and fresh pear. It might be mistaken for Chardonnay, except for the extra weight that carries through the lengthy finish. Though it's tempting to describe white Pinot Noirs as sparkling wines without the sparkle, this is much more interesting, and one of the rare examples that defines both a style and a standard for the rest..
