country: US.
description: This wine has varied over the years, but with the cool 2010 vintage, it really shows how fine its terroir can shine. A full degree of alcohol lower than the 2009, it's bone dry, brisk in acidity, and stimulating in its minerally taste and textureâ€”like a lick of cold steel. There is a fortunate streak of Meyer lemon candy that lends enough richness to satisfy. Reminiscent of a fine Chablis, it's drinking well now..
