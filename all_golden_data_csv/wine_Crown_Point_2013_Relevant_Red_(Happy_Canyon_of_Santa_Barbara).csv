country: US.
description: This is the first ultraluxury release from this label by entrepreneur Roger Bower and winemaker Adam Henkel, and the blend of 30% Syrah, 30% Malbec, 30% Petit Verdot and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon is a stunner. Dark as night and extremely viscous in the glass, this shows deep blueberry, uncrushed peppercorns and touches of smoked meat on the nose. Thick and lush flavors of blueberry, smoked coffee bean and roasted meat jump onto the palate with glee. This attention-grabber will last for years, but it is very accessible out of the gates..
