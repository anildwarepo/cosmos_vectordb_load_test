short_description: Lying on a bend of the Ayeyarwady River in the central plain of Myanmar, Bagan is a sacred landscape, featuring an exceptional range of Buddhist art and architecture.

The property bears spectacular testimony to the peak of Bagan civilization (11th -13thÂ centuries CE), when the site was the capital of a regional empire.
