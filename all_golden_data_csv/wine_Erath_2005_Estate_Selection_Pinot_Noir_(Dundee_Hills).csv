wine_Erath_2005_Estate_Selection_Pinot_Noir_(Dundee_Hills),"Unnamed: 0: 46202.
country: US.
description: This is a blend of five different Dundee Hills sites, and as is often the case in Oregon, delivers more accessible and complete flavors than some of the winery's individual vineyard-designated wines. It's herbal and spicy, with strong scents of tomato leaf and root beer. The fruit is tart and clean, and the wine comes out swinging, but then it falls away in the back end, adding just a lick of vanilla as a sweet coda..
