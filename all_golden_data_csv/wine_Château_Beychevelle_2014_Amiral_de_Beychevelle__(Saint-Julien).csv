country: France.
description: The second wine of fourth-growth Beychevelle is named after a 17th century owner, French Admiral de la Valette, who insisted passing ships in the Gironde estuary salute his riverfront property. The wine is a proper second wine, firm while also showing the way it will develop relatively quickly. Juicy black currants and generous tannins are balanced with acidity and a dry core. This fine wine will be ready to drink from 2021..
