Description: This volume is a collection of primary documents of the writings of early California settlers. Taking the point of view of the Indians, settlers, missionaries, soldiers, and others who lived there, the editors offer letters, reports, reminiscences, and other documents that tell the inside story of California before the Gold Rush, from the time the Spanish arrived in the 1530s until the end of California's experience as a territory in the Mexican republic in the 1840s. This work is illustrated with maps, portraits, sketches, and early photographs as well as seven color plates of drawings depicting plant and animal life made by an 18th-century Czech priest..
