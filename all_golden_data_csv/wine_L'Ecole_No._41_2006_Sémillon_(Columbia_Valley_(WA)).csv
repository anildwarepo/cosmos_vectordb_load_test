wine_L'Ecole_No._41_2006_Sémillon_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 64016.
country: US.
description: This wine is formulaic in a good way; L'Ecole “owns” Sémillon in Washington, and it is hard to think of any winery in the country that does a better job with the grape. Aged sur lie in neutral oak, blended with 14% Sauvignon Blanc and put through malolactic for added creaminess, this is a delicious, rich and succulent wine that deftly mixes flavors of nettle, lime and melon with vanilla custard and a hint of butterscotch..
