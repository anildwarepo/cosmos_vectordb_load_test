wine_Tre_Nova_2009_Ripasso_Red_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 22457.
country: US.
description: Barbera, Sangiovese and Nebbiolo comprise the wine. Half of the grapes were air dried for three months, which is known as appassimento. The Sangiovese was crushed and fermented conventionally before being added to the blend. The result is a dry, slightly nutty red wine, with tart flavors that are suggestive of fruit leather. It shows good grip and length, and it comes with just a bit of alcoholic heat..
