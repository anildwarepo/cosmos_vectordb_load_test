country: US.
description: Tasted in summer, 2013, this Cab was so tannic it was basically undrinkable. The astringency locks down the palate, but through it are faintly discernible notes of the wine's richness, in the form of incredibly concentrated blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate and smoky oak. Give this wine at least eight years in the cellar, and it should be providing plenty of delicious pleasure for an additional decade beyond that, if not even longer..
