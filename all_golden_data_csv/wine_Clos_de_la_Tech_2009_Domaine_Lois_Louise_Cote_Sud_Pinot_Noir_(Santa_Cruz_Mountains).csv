country: US.
description: From the estate vineyard of a winery founded in 1994 by Silicon Valley mogul TJ Rodgers of Cypress Semiconductor, the grapes must be picked by a special tractor-on-wires because they are so steeply planted. Like the other 2009s, this Pinot Noir is characterized by strong tannins, meaning that it will last. Unlike the others, this one boats a more mushroom-driven nose between shiitake and porcini, with a touch of mocha. The palate reveals caramelized raspberry, graphite and silty flavors..
