country: US.
description: The most affordable of Harper Voit's 2013 lineup, this deeply aromatic wine offers up a lush mix of rose petals and other perfumed floral scents, along with hints of rhubarb and cherry. Elegant on the palate, it's a poised and balanced wine that brings to mind the old line about Ginger Rogers doing everything Fred Astaire did, only backwards and in high heels. Here the dance includes ripe strawberries, cherries, flowers and a long, graceful encore..
