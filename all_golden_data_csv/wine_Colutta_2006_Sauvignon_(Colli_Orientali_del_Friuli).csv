wine_Colutta_2006_Sauvignon_(Colli_Orientali_del_Friuli),"Unnamed: 0: 115813.
country: Italy.
description: Thanks to a special clone of Sauvignon, Giorgio Colutta has successfully paired this international variety to his unique territory, creating a distinctively Italian wine. Fresh aromas include citrus zest, wild sage, chopped herbs and kiwi yet the sharp edges you might find in French or New Zealand versions are absent. The wine boasts good acidity and a bright, zesty finish that cleans the palate and would pair perfectly with vegetable based exotic appetizers. Fire roasted eggplant with cumin, potato samosa or red lentil patties would stand up to the wine's gentle aromatic intensity..
