country: US.
description: Delara is Maysara's mid-priced Pinot Noir. The wine is a block selection, and it is still rather tightly wound, despite the extra time in bottle. The fruit is dark and laden with exotic spices, and as you dive into the flavors you find smoke, licorice, earth and rock. This is a wine that would be quite interesting to age, but if you drink it now, be sure to spend time with it, as it runs through its delightful changes. Decanting is highly recommended..
