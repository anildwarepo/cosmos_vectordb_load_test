country: Spain.
description: Dalmau, the ultrapremium Tempranillo blend from Marques de Murrieta, is 65% pricier in 2004 than '03. And that might be justified. This is a spectacular wine in every sense of the word. The nose blends alluring scents of smoke, asphalt, rubber and black fruit. The palate is saturated and smooth, with black cherry and blackberry flavors leading the way. Coffee, berry pie and mocha help the finish hold court and then fade away. Already good but best from 2010–2020..
