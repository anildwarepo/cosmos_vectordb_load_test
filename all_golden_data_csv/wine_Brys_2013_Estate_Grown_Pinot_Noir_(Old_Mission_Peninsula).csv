country: US.
description: While the nose seems dominated by oak, with charred bacon and cola aromas, the palate shows plenty of fruit, offering velvety dark cherry in the lead. Savory spice notes streak across the plush, structured palate, giving way to a mocha finish. There's enough acidity and tannic structure to explore how this will develop in the years to come. Give it another year or two for the oak to integrate further..
