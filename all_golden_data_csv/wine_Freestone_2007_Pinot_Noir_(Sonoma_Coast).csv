country: US.
description: Long hangtime fruit is the star of this Pinot, which is pretty much as good as the winery's more expensive bottlings, making it a comparative value. The raspberry, cherry, tea, cola and Indian spice flavors developed perfectly in this perfect vintage, giving the wine an elaborate richness, while crisp coastal acidity provides balancing tartness. It wants some time in the cellar. Give it until 2012 to begin to develop bottle complexity..
