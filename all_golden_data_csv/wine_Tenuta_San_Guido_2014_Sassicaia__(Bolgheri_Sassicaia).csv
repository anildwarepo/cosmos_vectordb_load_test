wine_Tenuta_San_Guido_2014_Sassicaia__(Bolgheri_Sassicaia),"Unnamed: 0: 95534.
country: Italy.
description: Aromas of red berry, blue flower, menthol, exotic spice and a whiff of French oak take shape on this impeccably balanced radiant red. The palate is vibrant and focused—almost ethereal—delivering raspberry compote, Marasca cherry, star anise and cinnamon framed in elegant tannins. Weightless and loaded with finesse, it's an incredible result for what was a cool wet vintage in most of Italy. Drink through 2024..
