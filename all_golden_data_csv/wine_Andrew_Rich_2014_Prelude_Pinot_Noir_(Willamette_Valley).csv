country: US.
description: A vertical red stripe reads “Twentieth Anniversary” along the left side of the front label. One suspects that such a milestone receives special care, and this certainly shows it. Aromatic with scents of cherries and blossoms, this is supported on a firm, almost steely frame of acid and tannin, and dotted with hints of herb and seed and grain. It's not a big wine, but given its chance, should age gracefully for up to a decade..
