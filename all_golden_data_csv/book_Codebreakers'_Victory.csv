Description: The first ever comprehensive look at World War II codebreaking and how it changed history, veteran cryptographer Haufler's accessible account is ground-breaking work based on years of research and interviews and the mining of previously top-secret archives. In compelling detail, Haufler shows us how cryptography brought the Japanese and Germans to their knees as only one who fought on the frontlines of this 'secret war' could tell it..
