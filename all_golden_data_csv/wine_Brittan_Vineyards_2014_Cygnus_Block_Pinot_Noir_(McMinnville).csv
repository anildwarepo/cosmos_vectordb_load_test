country: US.
description: This new cuvée is sourced from a 2008 planting of the Swan clone, rare in Oregon. The aromatics are dazzling, with a lightly peppery, meaty aspect around slightly muted notes of herb and rock. The fruit is especially generous, with blackberry and boysenberry predominant. The wine is stylish, with cut and precision. Though truly exceptional, it needs your complete attention and some extra aeration to show its best..
