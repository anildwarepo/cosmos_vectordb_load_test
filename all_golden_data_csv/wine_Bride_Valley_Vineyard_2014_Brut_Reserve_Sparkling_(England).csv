country: England.
description: There is almost something of the sea breeze in this wine. An alluring iodine hint on the nose mixes with notions of green apple and the merest touch of rhubarb. The palate comes in with a smooth, fine mousse of tiny, creamy bubbles that counterpoint the inherent English briskness. Slender and elegant, the palate gears everything to a fresh finish of green apple and lemon purity that lingers. It's harmonious, refreshing and balanced..
