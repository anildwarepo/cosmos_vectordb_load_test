country: US.
description: Pure Cabernet Sauvignon from older vines, the Cold Creek bottling often begins life rather compact, even hard, and will usually benefit from some years of bottle age. This 2005 is a tough, somewhat stemmy wine, with tightly wound black fruits, herbs and leather wrapped into its core. Tannic and unyielding, even after some hours of breathing time, it is a bit too soon to know exactly how good it will ultimately become..
