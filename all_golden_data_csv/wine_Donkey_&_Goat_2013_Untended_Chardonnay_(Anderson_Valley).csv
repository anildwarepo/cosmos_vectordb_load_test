country: US.
description: An impression of this light-bodied wine starts with a vivid golden-yellow color and enticing aromas of fresh bread dough and marzipan. The taste itself is more lean than the aromas, showing crisp lemon and apricot notes, noticeable acidity and a tart finish. It has a taut, dry character that is not typical in California, but the wine is fascinating and keeps improving for a day or two after opening..
