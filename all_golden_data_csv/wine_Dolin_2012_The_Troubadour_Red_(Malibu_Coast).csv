country: US.
description: One of Elliott Dolin's first attempts at a red blend from this coastal appellation, this blend of 42% Cabernet Franc, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Syrah and 9% Petit Verdot offers an elegant nose of elderflower, dried blueberry, black pepper, oregano and crushed gravel minerality. It's dense and bone-dry on the palate, its concentrated lilac, violet and blueberry syrup flavors framed by chalky tannins..
