country: France.
description: A rich floral notion of dandelion precedes the rich aroma of ripe peaches on the nose. The palate opens into a kind of vast peach mellowness, edged with a touch of citrus zest and a grounding, earthy element. A gentle sweetness boosts the peachy roundedness but does not dominate. This is gentle on the surface but very concentrated at the core. It is on the off-dry finish that the lemon zest comes though triumphantly. Drink 2017–2027..
