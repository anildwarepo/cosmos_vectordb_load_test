country: US.
description: This Bordeaux-style blend leads with 50% Cabernet Sauvignon. Very dark in color and potent in flavor, the wine has grand proportions but is finely polished, leaving no rough edges. It starts with light wood smoke and cedar aromas, and proceeds to mouthfilling black-cherry and dark-chocolate flavors on a creamy but moderately tannic texture. The tannins are well integrated, the flavors are deep and persistent. Best after 2022..
