Instructions:.
- Begin filling: Combine citron, currants, and orange juice in a lidded jar. Add enough water to cover fruit. Seal and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight..
- Prepare dough: Combine milk, sugar, and cubed butter in a small pot over medium-low heat. Heat until butter melts and mixture is warmed to 110 degrees F (43 degrees C). Pour into the bowl of a stand mixer and add yeast; let proof for 13 minutes..
- Stir eggs into the milk-yeast mixture. Gradually add flour and salt and knead with the dough hook until well combined. Transfer dough to a floured work surface and knead by hand for 5 minutes..
- Transfer dough to a lightly oiled bowl and flip to coat all sides. Cover lightly and allow to rise at room temperature until 1 1/2 times its size, about 3 1/2 hours..
- Punch down dough. Place on a floured work surface and divide into 3 equal portions. Shape into balls and let rest for 15 minutes..
- Meanwhile, finish filling: Remove citron-currant mixture from the refrigerator. Drain liquid. Mix sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl..
- Roll marzipan on a floured silicone pad into three 9x11-inch sheets, using a floured plastic fondant roller..
- Roll one portion of dough on a floured surface into a 10x12-inch rectangle. Cover the whole surface with 1/3 of the melted butter. Turn dough so the long end is facing you. Layer with 1/3 of the cinnamon-sugar mixture, leaving 1/2 inch at the sides and 1 inch at the top uncovered. Sprinkle 1/3 of the citron-currant mixture over the cinnamon-sugar, then 1/3 of the finely chopped pecans. Top with a sheet of marzipan..
- Start at the bottom edge and roll the dough carefully away from you and around the filling; be sure to keep the edges clean. When you reach the last 1 1/2 inches, fold the top down and pinch to seal the roll. Fold in the sides and pinch to seal..
- Flip the roll so the seam is facing down. Use a rolling pin to roll out a 6 1/2x14-inch rectangle. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover and let rest for 40 minutes..
- Repeat Steps 8 to 10 with remaining dough, filling ingredients, and marzipan..
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)..
- Bake in the preheated oven until light golden brown, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack for 1 1/2 to 2 hours..
- Make icing: combine water, meringue powder, and salt in a mixing bowl. Mix on high speed until meringue becomes sloppy and bubbly. Add 1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar and mix until smooth and well combined. Mix in remaining sugar gradually until consistency is like thick honey..
- Spread just enough icing on each cooled loaf to act as a glue. Top with pecans and then candied fruit..
