country: US.
description: Hestan only makes this one white wine. Though its beginnings might seem humble, the juice in the bottle surely will change anyone's mind. This is liquid gold in color, with deep petrol aromas and a note of toasted caramel oak.It's superbly balanced, with minerality winning the dayâ€”especially on the finish. This wine starts out like a California blockbuster but finishes very elegantly, with finesse..
