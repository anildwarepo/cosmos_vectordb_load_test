country: South Africa.
description: A Bordeaux-style blend of 56% Merlot, 24% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Cabernet Franc, 4% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot, the Z is typically more immediately approachable than the Fusion V. The structure is still firm and supported by medium tannins, but the black-fruit core is the star all around, with lush notes of boysenberry, cr√®me de cassis, blackberry, fig and damson plum throughout. Hints of cigar-box spice and leather add depth and intrigue..
