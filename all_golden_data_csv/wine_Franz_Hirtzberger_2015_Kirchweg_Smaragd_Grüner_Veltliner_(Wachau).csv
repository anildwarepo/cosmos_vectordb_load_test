country: Austria.
description: An appetizing top note of candied lemon peel hovers over the glass before spicy hints of pear peel become apparent. The palate is edged with very precise zesty grapefruit hints that frame and corset a most generously white-pepper-spiced host of pear and yellow plum fruit. It is the structure of that zesty acidity that make this luminous and appetizing. This is rich but concentrated; delicious now but built to last. Drink 2017–2035..
