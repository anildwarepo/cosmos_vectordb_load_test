country: US.
description: A big, vital and important Cabernet that deserves a place in the cellar. It hits the mouth with huge tannins that are tight and locked down, yet sweetly ripe. That contradiction persists throughout the fantastically complex blackberry, cherry, currant and mocha flavors. A very fine, superior wine that exemplifies the Stags Leap iron fist in a velvet glove. As delicious as it is, you should hold this Cabernet for a good six years, and it could easily develop for an additional decade..
