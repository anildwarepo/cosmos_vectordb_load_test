wine_Notre_Vin_2006_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Howell_Mountain),"Unnamed: 0: 51376.
country: US.
description: Mostly Cabernet, with a small percentage of the other Bordeaux varieties, this is a very rich, dramatically layered wine. It's notable for both its intensely smooth tannins and the lush fruit, which suggests waves of raspberries, cherries, red currants, licorice, rose petals and oak, courtesy of 100% new French barrels. Yet there's an underlying minerality that gives firmness and grounding. Feels ultrarich on the palate now, and should ride out the next decade with ease..
