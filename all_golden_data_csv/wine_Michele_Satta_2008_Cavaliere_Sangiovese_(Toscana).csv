country: Italy.
description: Blue flowers, wild berries, leather, dried herb and tilled soil are just some of the aromas you'll find on this stunning wine, along with a balsamic note. Made entirely with Sangiovese, the smooth, structured palate delivers layers of black cherries, crushed raspberries, white pepper, clove, dried mint and sage inside a framework of velvety tannins. A tobacco note tops off the lingering finish. Enjoy through 2020..
