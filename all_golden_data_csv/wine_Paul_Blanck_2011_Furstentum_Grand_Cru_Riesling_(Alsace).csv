wine_Paul_Blanck_2011_Furstentum_Grand_Cru_Riesling_(Alsace),"Unnamed: 0: 68659.
country: France.
description: The nose is closed and gives a little lemon and chamomile lift. The palate is more expressive: concentrated lemon and mandarin zest play aromatically on a zesty, pure and very streamlined and dry palate. There is something incisive and intense about this. There also are glimpses of floral peachy edges that will only increase with age. This is ready now but has the stuffing to go the mileage: drink now through 2030..
