wine_Coeur_d'Alene_2005_Opulence_Syrah_(Washington),"Unnamed: 0: 35589.
country: US.
description: Opulence is the winery's reserve Syrah, and it is a robust, tooth-staining wine that takes no prisoners. Dense scents suggest a pig roast on a pile of licorice sticks; the aromas are almost visceral. The fruit has been very well handled and the tannins, though full and powerful, have been polished to a satiny sheen. There's a little chalkiness to the finish, perhaps from acidification, but that may well resolve with a little more bottle age..
