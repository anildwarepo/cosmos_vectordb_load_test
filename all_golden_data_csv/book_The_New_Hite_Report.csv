Description: This new report includes previously unpublished data and personal accounts from women in the UK and Commonwealth. The original ""Hite Report on Female Sexuality"" was based on samples of women exclusively in the USA. First published in 1976, it explored women's feelings about sex and has had a profound influence on generations of readers. In it, women between the ages of 14 and 78 described their most intimate feelings and answered questions about orgasm, masturbation and their sexual desires. This book brings Shere Hite's thinking to a new generation of women and draws conclusions based on up-to-date and relevant worldwide findings to one of the most probing surveys ever undertaken..
