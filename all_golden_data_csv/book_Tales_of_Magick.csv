Description: ""Kick Ass! And Live to Tell About It! Some people think the Awakened sit around dreaming about Ascension. Wrong. Dead wrong. When reality itself is on the brink of destruction, you don't contemplate your navel. You fight -- and sometimes die -- for the sake of the future. Tales of Magick takes Mage from the realm of abstraction and kicks it screaming into high gear. If you ever wondered how to run an epic, exciting modern sorcery chronicle, Dark Adventure is for you. Indeed, Tales of Magick is an ongoing series of books dedicated to playing Mage in a variety of genres and settings. Now your Mage game can go anywhere, anywhen""..
