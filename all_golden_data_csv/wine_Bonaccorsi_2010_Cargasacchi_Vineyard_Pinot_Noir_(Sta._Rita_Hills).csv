description: Making Pinot Noir this sensually delicious is only half the effort. The challenge is to provide balance. Winemaker Jenne Lee Bonaccorsi succeeds wildly with this wine. The vineyard is planted entirely with the Dijon clone 115, and the wine shows the purest raspberry and cherry fruitâ€”focused and intense. Yet there are all sorts of earthy, mushroomy, oaky complexities. Gorgeous now, and will hold for at least six years..
