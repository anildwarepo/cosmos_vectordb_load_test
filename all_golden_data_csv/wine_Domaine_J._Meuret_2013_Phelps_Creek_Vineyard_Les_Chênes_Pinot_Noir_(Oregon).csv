description: It takes a precision winemaker to craft a Pinot Noir with such detail from a cool vintage in a cool region. Jon Meuret (founder of Maison Bleue) has the right stuff, as this new project demonstrates. Drink it now for its pure raspberry and cranberry fruit, its lightly rendered oak, its length and texture. Or wait 8–10 years and watch it develop into a complex, elegant wine with mature fruit and polished, terroir-driven flavors. Drink now through 2026..
