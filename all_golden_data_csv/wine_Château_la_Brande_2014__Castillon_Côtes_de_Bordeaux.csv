country: France.
description: Anne-Marie and Jean-Guy Todeschini started a revolution here and at Château Mangot and sons Karl and Yann (mid-Millennials) are moving it on. They use Jean-Pierre Cousinié's terroir analysis (look it up), no pesticides, experiment with no sulfur and are changing the way their terroir talks to the wine. This vintage is a rich wine with attractive black currant fruit and fine acidity. With structured tannins and light spice, it is fruity, juicy and will be ready to drink from 2018..
