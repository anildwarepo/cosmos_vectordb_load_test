country: New Zealand.
description: This blend of 50% Merlot, 45% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc is ambitiously priced, but the quality is in the bottle. Next time you need a ringer for a right-bank Bordeaux tasting, here's a perfect candidate. Dried spices and a smooth, rich texture are the only hallmarks left from two years of barrel agingâ€”the mocha and black cherry fruit is rich and luscious, developing tobacco nuances on the moderately tannic finish. Drink now and over the next 10 years..
