country: France.
description: Yeasty funk hangs heavy on the nose and will need time to clear. The palate underneath, however, shines with a cool, composed and serene brightness. This is taut, and as beautiful and fresh as a shooting star on a cold night, brightening everything around it while sticking to its energetic course. Tart apple and ripe citrus are at the core and create a well of future pleasure. A cool bone-dry and slender but beguiling Riesling..
