wine_M_by_Michael_Mondavi_2009_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Napa_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 87611.
country: US.
description: Expensive, yes, but defines the soft, luxurious modern style of extreme deliciousness. Made with a drop of Petit Verdot that seems to add depth, the wine is fantastically rich in blackberry, blueberry and cherry jam, chocolate and sweet oak. The tannins are a wonder, and there's just enough acidity to give a balanced tang. Will it age? Yes, but for how long is the question. Beautiful now and through 2019..
