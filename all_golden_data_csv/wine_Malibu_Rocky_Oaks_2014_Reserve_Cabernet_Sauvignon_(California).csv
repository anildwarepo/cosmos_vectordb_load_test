country: US.
description: One of the more promising wines coming out of the newer Malibu area, this Cab that is boosted by 10% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc. It shows deep blueberry, black currant and black olive on the nose, along with dill, pepper, spearmint and caramel-laced fudge. The intriguing palate offers black olive, black pepper and dark, deep fruit. It's well structured and tasty, like a salt- and pepper-crusted steak..
