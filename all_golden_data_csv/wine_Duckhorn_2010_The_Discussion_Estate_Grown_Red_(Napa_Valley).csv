wine_Duckhorn_2010_The_Discussion_Estate_Grown_Red_(Napa_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 123763.
country: US.
description: Given extra time in the bottle, this wine combines a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, aged entirely in French oak. The entry is sanguine and generous in red currant and denser blackberry, while elements of thyme lurk on the back of the palate. While the tannins remain sizable, they're silky, and should take on additional plushness in time. Cellar through 2020..
