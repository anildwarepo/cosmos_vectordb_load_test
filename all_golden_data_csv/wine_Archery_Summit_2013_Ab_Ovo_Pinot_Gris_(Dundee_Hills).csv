country: US.
description: This wine is rich and expressive, with the grip and texture of a fine Chardonnay—but it's Pinot Gris. Roughly half was fermented in a concrete egg; the rest in stainless steel and one new acacia barrel. The fruit is fleshy but not fat, crisply defined with exceptional phenolic details of citrus skin. The underlying minerality further frames the ripe, tangy fruit, and the three-dimensional flavors expand and extend through a lingering finish..
