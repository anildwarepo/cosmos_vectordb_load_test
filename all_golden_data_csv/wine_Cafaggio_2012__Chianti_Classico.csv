wine_Cafaggio_2012__Chianti_Classico,"Unnamed: 0: 115339.
country: Italy.
description: A pure expression of Sangiovese, this classically crafted wine offers aromas of wild berry, blue flowers, sun-baked earth, clove and a whiff of menthol. The generous, open palate doles out juicy black cherry, plum, white pepper, mint and cinnamon while smooth, polished tannins provide support. It's already accessible but will age well for another few years. An anisette note signals the close. Drink through 2018..
