country: US.
description: L'Ecole's Columbia Valley Cabernet is again 100% varietal; the blending magic comes from a mix of excellent vineyards. This is a classy, classic wine, with pinpoint structure and spot-on varietal character. The compact palate is packed with details, and though it's drinking well, it is clearly a wine to cellar for a while longer. Notes of clean earth, clover, herb and light chocolate add depth to a core of black cherry and cassis..
