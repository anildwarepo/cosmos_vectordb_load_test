description: Though the 2013 vintage has generally been deemed a challenging one, this astonishing bottling proves that great wine can be made somewhere in almost any year. This warm and fruity, perfectly structured single-vineyard effort opens with a smooth and supple palate offering strawberry and cherry fruit, defining acidity and superb length. Give it a few hours to breathe and it shows depth, finesse and the ability to age and improve through 2025 and beyond..
