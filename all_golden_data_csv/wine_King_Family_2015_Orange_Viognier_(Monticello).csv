country: US.
description: Winemaker Matthieu Finot deftly transforms this wine by keeping it on the skins for three weeks with a daily punch-downs, then allowing 100% malolactic fermentation during aging in neutral oak. This orange wine boasts a gorgeous bouquet of fresh apricot, orange blossom and rooibos tea. These aromas transition onto the palate where they taste concentrated and fresh. It's dry, with delicate tannins and a clean finish that lingers and evolves..
