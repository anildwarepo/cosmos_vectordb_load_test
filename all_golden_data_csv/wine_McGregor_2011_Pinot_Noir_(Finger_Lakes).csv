country: US.
description: A line up of McGregor's 2010 and 2011 Pinot Noirs make a bold statement for Finger Lakes Pinot, but the regular label 2011 is drinking particularly well now. Lifted violet and berry notes are intoxicating on this spicy, deftly balanced wine. Rich, ripe black-cherry and raspberry flavors blend into a liquid silk on the palate, but are framed squarely by fine-grained tannins and a spray of cranberry acidity. The finish goes on and on. Likely to drink beautifully from now through at least 2020..
