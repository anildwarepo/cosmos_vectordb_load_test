country: Chile.
description: Still our favorite Malbec from Chile, Viu 1 rises above the rest due to its pedal-to-the-metal combination of fruit, perfect oak and human attention. The bouquet here is deep and sultry, with oily black fruit and toasty aromas working a perfect pas de deux. The black plum, blackberry and leather flavors hit the spot courtesy of proper acidity and tannins, and the the finish is thick but not fierce or fat. Drink now (decant) through 2013..
