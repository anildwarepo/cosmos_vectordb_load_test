country: South Africa.
description: This organic bottling, made by the winery's former Winemaker Craig Hawkins (who now spearheads his own brand, Testalonga), is a blend of 54% Chenin Blanc, 31% Viognier and 15% Chardonnay. There's an immediately attractive richness to the nose, thanks to upfront notes of beeswax, honeysuckle, Asian pear, yellow apple and a touch of guava. The medium-weight mouthfeel is surprisingly direct and clean, with tart white fruit and pure citrus tones that carry through to the bright finish. Drink nowâ€“2018..
