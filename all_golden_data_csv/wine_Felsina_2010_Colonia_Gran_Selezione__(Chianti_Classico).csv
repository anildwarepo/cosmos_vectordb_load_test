country: Italy.
description: Firmly structured but elegant, this offers aromas of blue flower, tobacco, tilled earth, black fruit and a balsamic note. The vibrant palate boasts wonderful intensity, weaving notes of white pepper, baking spice, savory herb, licorice and mineral around a black cherry core. It's young and austere but impeccably balanced with firm acidity and assertive but fine-grained tannins. Give it time to unwind and develop complexity. Drink 2018–2030..
