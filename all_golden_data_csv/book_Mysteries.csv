Description: Through his own cathartic experiences, Colin Wilson discovered that human beings consist of a ladder or hierarchy of selves, whose upper members may be called on at will for personal transformation and deep knowledge. ""Mysteries"" attempts to explain all paranormal phenomena -- from precognition to Uri Geller's spoon bending -- in terms of this theory. Included are detailed studies of haunting, possession, and "" demonic hypnosis, "" and also of magic, the Kabbalah, and astrology. At the heart of the book is a fascinating chapter on the "" Great Secret"" of the alchemists, which Wilson sees as the key to the mystery of the "" ladder of selves."".
