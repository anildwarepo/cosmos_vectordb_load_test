country: US.
description: Quite light in color with almost an orange hue, this wine brings exuberant aromas of white pepper, fresh herb, red fruit, stem, smoked meat and potpourri. The palate is light, elegant and transparent in style with vibrant fruit, spice and savory flavors that linger on the extended finish and kick it up a notch. The oak influence is dialed way back. It delivers a lot of enjoyment on its own but should really sing at the dinner table..
