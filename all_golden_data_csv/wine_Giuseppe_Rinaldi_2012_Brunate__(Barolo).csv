wine_Giuseppe_Rinaldi_2012_Brunate__(Barolo),"Unnamed: 0: 4513.
country: Italy.
description: Multifaceted aromas of rose, iris, leather, cranberry, truffle and the barest hint of game lead the nose. The radiant palate offers creamy strawberry, ripe red cherry, orange zest, baking spice, dried herb and tobacco alongside firm but polished tannins. Fresh acidity provides balance while a mineral vein energizes the finish. With its smooth texture, it's already tempting but hold for even more complexity. Drink 2018–2026..
