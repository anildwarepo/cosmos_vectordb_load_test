country: US.
description: This is actually a 100% varietal Cabernet Sauvignon from the producer's estate, and a selection of the winemaker's three favorite barrels of the vintage that fit best together. It is also the first release of the wine, made to honor the winery's 10th anniversary. Savory and high-toned in acidity, it masters a tartness of currant, cranberry and clove while integrating a soft, lean lushness of black cherry, the whole succulent and complex..
