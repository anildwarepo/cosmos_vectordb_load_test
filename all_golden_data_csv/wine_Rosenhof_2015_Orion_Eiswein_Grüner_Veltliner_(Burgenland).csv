country: Austria.
description: The fragrant, absolute varietal purity of green pear and grapefruit zest attains an additional thrill of orange-peel lift. The palate is sweet but not overwhelmingly so: all is balanced and countered by freshness and a light touch. This richness dances on ballerina's tiptoe. That aromatic streak of citrus freshness unites grapefruit and greengage, honey and lime. This is utter purity of fruit in an Eiswein of immense, irresistible charm with moreish, lemon-pure length..
