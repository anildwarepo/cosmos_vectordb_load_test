description: Winemaker Bill Owen (the ‘O' in O•S) has a knack for making white wines from red wine vineyards. This pungent, ripe, stylish Sauvignon Blanc/Sémillon blend is a fine example. The fruit flavors are thick and juicy— pineapple, golden apple, citrus—and the herbaceous nature of the grape has been transmuted into a sweet grassy streak, supported with mouth-searing acids. It's a roller-coaster ride, and delicious all along the way..
