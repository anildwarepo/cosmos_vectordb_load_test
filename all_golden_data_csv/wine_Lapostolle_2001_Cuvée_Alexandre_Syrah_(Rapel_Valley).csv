wine_Lapostolle_2001_Cuvée_Alexandre_Syrah_(Rapel_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 114122.
country: Chile.
description: This is a new wine from one of Chile's most consistent producers, and it's quite the saturated bruiser. The color is deep purple, while the nose is raw and heavy, with deep fruit and plenty of bacon-like character. The mouth is like blackberry pie, while the feel is full and tannic, although not at all offensive or tough. The finish is dark, brooding and just a little bitter. An interesting new entry to Chile's roster, and one that's very well oaked..
