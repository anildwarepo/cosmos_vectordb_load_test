country: Italy.
description: This is a fascinating wine that represents the first bottling of a newly discovered grape called Sirica (only 690 bottles have been produced). Genetic research shows that the grape shares characteristic with Syrah but that its lineage extends deep into ancient times. The wine is simply delicious with soft layers of chocolate, cherry and spice and balanced firmness on the close. A great item for collectors..
