wine_Super_Sonoman_2008_Syrah_(Sonoma_County),"Unnamed: 0: 63235.
country: US.
description: This is delicious, right up there with a great Cabernet. First of all, there's the smoothly tannic and velvety mouthfeel. Then there's the flavors that are wildly attractive in blackberries, black licorice, crispy bacon and something purple and flowery, like violets. The grapes comes from a vineyard in the Mayacamas range that only qualifies for the county appellation. It's expensive, yes, but it tastes expensive..
