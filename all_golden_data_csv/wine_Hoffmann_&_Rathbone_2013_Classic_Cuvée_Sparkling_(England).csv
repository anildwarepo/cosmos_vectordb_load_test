description: Notes of apple immediately rise from the glass: Ripe and mellow Golden Delicious as well as crisp Granny Smith. A background of shortbread appears with a little more air. On the palate the mousse is very lively, almost frothy, highlighting the briskness and freshness of this cuvée. Crisp apple and citrus notes underline the purity and freshness against a backdrop of subtle autolysis. The finish is bright and clean..
