country: US.
description: This Pinot seems to float weightlessly on the palate, yet the flavors sink in instantly and dazzle. Suggestions of raspberries and red cherries come spiced in white pepper and cinnamon, with richer levels of Dr. Pepper cola, mocha and red licorice, all highlighted with the most perfect acidity. It's easy to fall in love with this wine and drink it now, but it can develop interesting complexities through 2020. The winery is Oregon-based and has a good history with Willamette Valley Pinot Noir..
