country: US.
description: An amazingly delicious Cabernet, this is so rich and lush in blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate and minerals, you just want to gulp down the whole bottle. The grapes are from a portion of the Wurtele Vineyard, which consistently produces spectacular Cabernets. The wine is rich enough to drink now for sheer power, but should easily hold in the bottle for years, gradually picking up bottle complexity. Only 106 cases were produced..
