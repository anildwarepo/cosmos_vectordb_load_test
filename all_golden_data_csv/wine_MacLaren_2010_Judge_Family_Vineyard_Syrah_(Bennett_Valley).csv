country: US.
description: This Sonoma-based winery, founded in 2007, specializes in cool-climate Syrah. Bennett Valley, southeast of Santa Rosa, is certainly a cool part of Sonoma County, and the cool 2010 vintage has given owner-winemaker Steve Law a great success. The wine oozes dramatic flavors of blackberry jam, licorice, dark chocolate, grilled bacon, fine herbs and black pepper, which come wrapped in firm but supple tannins. The dry finish is long—the mark of a well-made, concentrated wine. Drink now–2016..
