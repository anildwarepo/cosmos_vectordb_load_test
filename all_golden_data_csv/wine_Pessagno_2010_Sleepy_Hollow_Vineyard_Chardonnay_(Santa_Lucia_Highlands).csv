country: US.
description: Rich doesn't begin to describe the layers of flavor and texture. This wine is massive, with notes of tropical fruit and apricot, with a slightly botrytized character that Sleepy Hollow Chardonnays often display. The oak is lavish and buttery, but perfectly matched to the wine's volume. It also has classic Monterey acidityâ€”as pert as a squeeze of lime. Delicious, full bodied and exotic, it defines its vineyard and appellation..
