Description: Riki Anne Wilchins has written the book that may take the discussion of gender over the top. In a voice that is by turns outraged, outrageous, sad, and hilarious, Wilchins - cofounder of the Transexual Menace and Executive Director of GenderPAC - weaves theory and personal experience into a story of self-discovery. Lesbians, feminists, queer academics, activists, transpeople, the ""queer-on-the-street,"" and mainstream readers hungry for writing that pushes the absolute edge of the gender envelope - Read My Lips will change the way you think about bodies, sex, and gender..
