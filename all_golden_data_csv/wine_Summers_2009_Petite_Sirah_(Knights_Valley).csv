country: US.
description: Grown in a highlands plateau between Napa Valley and the Russian River Valley, this shows the varietal's bigtime tannins, but it's lighter in body than you might expect. It's delicious in blackberry, currant, grilled meat and sandalwood flavors. This is one of the more elegant and sophisticated Petite Sirahs of the vintage. It's showing its best now and will continue to drink well over the next few years..
