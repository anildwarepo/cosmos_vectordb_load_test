description: This is the personal project of Robert Mondavi's longtime winemaker, Genevieve Janssens, and her husband, Luc. Production is only 250 cases. The blend is of the two Cabs, Sauvignon and Franc. The quality of the tannins is perfect, and so is the effortless way the wine has absorbed 100% new French oak without the wood sticking out. My only criticism, and it's a big one, is excessive ripeness that makes it Port-like. The alcohol is 15.5%..
