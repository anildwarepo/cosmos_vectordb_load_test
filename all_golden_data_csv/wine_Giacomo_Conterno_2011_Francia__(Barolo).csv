wine_Giacomo_Conterno_2011_Francia__(Barolo),"Unnamed: 0: 4522.
country: Italy.
description: Roberto Conterno didn't make his flagship Monfortino in this vintage so he blended the juice destined for this iconic wine into Francia. It opens with enticing aromas of dark berry, underbrush, baking spice, mineral and a balsamic note that carry over to the powerful palate, along with juicy raspberry, licorice and tobacco. It's big and structured but also shows balance and complexity. Drink 2019–2029..
