country: France.
description: A clean-cut top note of citrus hovers above the otherwise still-closed nose. The palate comes in with a concentrated richness that is as much sustained by residual sweetness as it is by sheer force of fruit: candied lemon and orange, juicy pear, ripe mirabelle and yellow peach. There also is a zesty spicy pithiness on the midpalate that frames and guides the wine alongside invigorating lemon freshness that lets this finish off dry despite the richness. This is yet to unfold fully. Lovely now, sure to improve. Drink 2020—2035..
