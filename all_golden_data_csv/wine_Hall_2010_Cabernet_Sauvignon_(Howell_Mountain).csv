country: US.
description: Here's the poster child for a massive Howell Mountain Cabernet. Made from 100% Cabernet, it shows the concentrated intensity of mountain fruit, with a molten core of blackberry essence, cassis liqueur, cola and spice flavors, liberally oaked and wrapped into gorgeously thick but fine tannins. So delicious now, it's hard to wait, but this wine is a guaranteed ager. The window is 2018â€“2020, at the very least..
