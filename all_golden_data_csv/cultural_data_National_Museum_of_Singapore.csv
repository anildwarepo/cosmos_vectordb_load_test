First Page Reviews: Using the app (v3.3.8) with the museum's WiFi (which is fast enough to download the app instantly) , the app is stuck in ""connecting"" status (on Huawei mate 20 phone) for our entire visit to the museum. it doesn't have much pictures of the artefacts and it would be better if there are more pictures related to the exhibitions How come no photos and so little artefacts? Can you make it easier to find? Within the ""About Us"" page links is corrupted. Once clicked, application stop working and restarts  Language system does not work. English changing to Mandarin  ""No content found for lookout code"".
