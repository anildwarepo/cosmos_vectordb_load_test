country: US.
description: There's quite a bit of new French oak used in this blend, adding complexity in the form of buttered toast notes. But the wine is really all about fruit—massive flavors of limes, Meyer lemons, apricots, oranges, pineapples, peaches and honey. While that sounds like a laundry list, if you pay attention you'll find each strand of the tapestry. At the same time, it's bone dry and balanced with acidity. Don't drink it too cold..
