country: US.
description: This vintage will be the last Resonance bottling under the Sineann label, as the vineyard has been sold to Burgundy's Louis Jadot. This delicious, ripe, detailed wine bursts with mixed red fruits. It's a lovely way to say goodbye, good luck and bon chance with the new owners. The perfectly ripened fruit is accented with toast, sandalwood and mocha as it heads into a deep, concentrated and lingering finish..
