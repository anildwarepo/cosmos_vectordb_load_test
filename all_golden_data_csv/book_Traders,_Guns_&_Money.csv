Description: Derivatives. Warren Buffett once called them 'financial weapons of mass destruction.' Unlike some WMDs, however, derivatives are easy to find: nowadays, thousands of companies use them to make money and protect against risk. But most derivatives buyers simply don't understand what they're dealing with and sellers are in no rush to enlighten them. This book will! Traders, Guns and Money is a sensational first-person expose of the derivatives business, straight from one of the industry's most widely-known experts. Satyajit Das has operated for decades on both the ""buy"" and ""sell"" side, and authored some of the field's leading references. Now, he's written the first no-holds-barred insider's guide To The real derivatives business..
