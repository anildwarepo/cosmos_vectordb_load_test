First Page Reviews: Decent, but camera feature doesn't always work so defining! Sweeeeeeeeeet Immersive, informative way to tour the museum by yourself! The actual ArtLens exhibit was underwhelming and the app occasionally crashes, but overall I love the layout, information, and ability to favorite items from the collection..
