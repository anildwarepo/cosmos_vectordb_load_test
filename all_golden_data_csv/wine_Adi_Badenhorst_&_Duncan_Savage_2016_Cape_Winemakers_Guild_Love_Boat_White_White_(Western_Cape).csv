country: South Africa.
description: Winemakers: Adi Badenhorst & Duncan Savage. The counterpart to the Love Boat Red is this kitchen sink white blend of  28% Sauvignon Blanc, 21% Grenache Blanc, 21% Roussanne, 15% Semillon, 9% Chenin Blanc and 6% Viognier. There's a ton going on, with new layers of aroma and flavor with each sniff and sip. Ripe scents of pineapple, melon, honeycomb, honeysuckle and spiced apple dance in the bouquet and transition through to the medium-weight palate. Medium acidity keeps the ripeness in check, lending verve to the lemon curd and baked apple fueled finish. It's delicious now, but should age gracefully through 2022..
