wine_Aril_2008_Syrah_(Atlas_Peak),"Unnamed: 0: 105637.
country: US.
description: Atlas Peak's reputation for Syrah can only grow as a result of this wine. It shows the massively dense fruit and firm mountain tannins of the appellation, as well as the ageability of Atlas Peak Cabernet Sauvignon, with which this Syrah could easily be confused. It has the blackberries and cherries and cassis, but that peppery, beef jerky sweetness is perhaps the giveaway. Cellar until at least 2014..
