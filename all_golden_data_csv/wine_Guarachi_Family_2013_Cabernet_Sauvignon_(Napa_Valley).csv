country: US.
description: Another of the producer's 100% varietal wines, this comes from two head-turning sites: Broken Rock Ranch at the foot of Atlas Peak, and Beckstoffer Las Piedras. The two marry well, offering sizable tannin and power atop complex layers of leather, cedar, pencil lead and coffee. Soft, integrated oak makes the wine enjoyable now, while its structure suggests further time in bottle, too. Drink now through 2021..
