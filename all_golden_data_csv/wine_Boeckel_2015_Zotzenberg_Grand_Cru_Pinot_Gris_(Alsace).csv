country: France.
description: Lovely enticing freshness of freshly cut Conference pear jumps from the glass. On the palate, the pear fruit becomes fleshed out with more juiciness and ripeness and shines with its pristine purity. There is a lovely phenolic edge that gives guiding structure alongside lemon freshness. This is concentrated but not heavy, rounded but utterly refreshing. This strikes a great balance between freshness and generosity and has a dry lip-smacking finish..
