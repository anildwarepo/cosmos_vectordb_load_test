description: One thing you can depend on concerning Clos du Val's Cabernets is that they're elegant. The winery resolutely refuses to kowtow to the modern style of ultraripe, extracted fruit, high alcohol and massive oak. This lovely Cab, which contains a drop of Merlot, defines their style, and is a joy to drink. It has rich, complex cherry and blackberry flavors, flecked with earth and herbs, and is just beginning a long journey. Nowâ€“2021, at least..
