title: The Rivers and the Sea.
text: Once upon a time all the Rivers combined to protest against the action of the Sea in making their waters salt. “When we come to you,” said they to the Sea, “we are sweet and drinkable: but when once we have mingled with you, our waters become as briny and unpalatable as your own.” The Sea replied shortly, “Keep away from me and you’ll remain sweet.”.
