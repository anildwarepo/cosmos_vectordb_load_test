country: France.
description: A touch of dried citrus peel on the nose suggests slight development. The palate adds judicious weight and backbone in the form of very fine creamy mousse and a lovely structure that holds mellow apple fruit and bright citrus. The finish is dry, fresh but mellow. Both autolysis and lemon freshness become apparent on the long aftertaste. It's a sophisticated, refreshing but rounded winter time apéritif..
