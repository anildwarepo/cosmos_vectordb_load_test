country: US.
description: This Riesling collaboration between Chateau Ste. Michelle and Ernst Loosen is no longer unique, but the wine has been fine-tuned over the years and sets a consistently high standard. This may be the most acidic ever made, but it is juicy rather than sour, and has a textural creaminess that adds both depth and length. The fruit flavors mix ripe apple and Mandarin orange, with hints of sweet lime and wet stone..
