wine_Torbreck_2009_Les_Amis_Grenache_(Barossa_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 75114.
country: Australia.
description: This aged for 18 months in new French barriques, and the influence of that is marked. Cedary, gently sawdusty notes and a touch of nail polish are apparent on the nose, while the palate is admirably full bodied and richly textured. The finish is generally velvety, but also shows hints of varnish or paint thinner. Overall, the raw materials are impressive, but the wine comes across as a bit disjointed..
