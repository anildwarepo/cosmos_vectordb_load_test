description: The 2005 Leonetti Reserve is all estate vineyard fruit—63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot and 20% Petit Verdot. It is saturated and dense. The fruit is dark, smoky, herbal, tight and loaded with licorice, tea leaf, black olive, hints of tar and graphite. Tannins are in perfect proportion, polished and ripe, with extra texture and weight. The finish is granular and detailed, but delicious accent flavors of almond candy and nougat keep piling into the extraordinary finish..
