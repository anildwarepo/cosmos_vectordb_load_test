country: France.
description: A rather lifted nose of peach and blossom creates a heady opening. There also is the merest hint of vanilla. The palate reprises these notes with creamy vanilla, ripe peach and honeysuckle. Warmth is palpable on this rather luscious, incredibly generous and still-evolving wine. The finish is beautifully corralled into zesty sweetness by ripe lemon. This is layered and complex and must be savored slowly. It will continue to develop. Drink 2017–2027..
