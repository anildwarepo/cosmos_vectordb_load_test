wine_Remo_Farina_1997_Ripasso__(Valpolicella_Classico_Superiore),"Unnamed: 0: 102858.
country: Italy.
description: The ripasso technique consists of passing the already completed “normal” Valpolicella back over the lees of the Amarone in the spring after vinification of the latter is complete. This results in a minor refermentation, adding extra alcohol and flavor. If the latter occurred in this particular version, it is not very evident. There is a modest amount of dry fruit present, but the mouth-searing acids and mouth-drying tannins hurt this wine..
