Application Description: From the 16th Century, when migrants travelled from their home country to Malaya (now Malaysia), some began to adopt the culture and inter-married with the locals. Their children were known as Peranakan.The Baba & Nyonya Heritage Museum was once home to a Peranakan Chinese family. Four generations of the family lived in these three terraced lots, before it was established as a museum by the family in 1985. This audio app takes visitors through the house. Guided by Baba GT Lye, a well respected member of the Peranakan Chinese community, visitors will hear the sounds of the house come to life as they walk through each room, into the richness of this hybrid culture. The museum is located on No 48 & 50 Jalan Tun Tan Cheng Lock, Melaka.Read moreCollapse.
