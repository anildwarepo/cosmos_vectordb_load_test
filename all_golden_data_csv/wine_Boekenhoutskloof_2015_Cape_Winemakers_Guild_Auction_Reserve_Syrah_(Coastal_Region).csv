country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Marc Kent. A blend of Syrah from Kent's Porseleinberg's Vineyard and an old Stellenbosch vineyard, this is a gripping and young Syrah, begging for some time to mature. Initially, aromas of church incense, fruit cake, licorice and fynbos lead the bouquet, with ripe black cherry and berry fruit at the core. It's rich and robust, with aggressive tannins that lend a gripping texture to the mouthfeel and a bittersweet cocoa astringency to the finish, alongside notes of char and black olive. Drink 2021â€“2026..
