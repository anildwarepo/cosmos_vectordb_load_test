description: Hedges is one of a handful of Washington wineries producing top- caliber wines in significant quantities. This is their best deeply colored, elegant and Bordeaux-like in style and substance. Powerful, muscular black cherry fruit blends with dense, firm tannins, highlighted with elements of iron and earth. The wine, though young and compressed, is a perfect expression of Red Mountain Cabernet. About 20% Merlot is also in the blend. 2,100 six-bottle cases made. Editors' Choice..
