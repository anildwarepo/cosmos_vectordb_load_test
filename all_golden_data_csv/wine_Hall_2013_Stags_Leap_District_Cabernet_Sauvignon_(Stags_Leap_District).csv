country: US.
description: This is a blockbuster of a wine, powerfully built grape by grape, with just a handful of Merlot. Cherry vanilla, leathery cedar and juicy plum combine around a lush, voluptuous mouthfeel of tension and tannin. Incredibly satisfying, it shows a length of spicy clove on the finish that appears to go on for days. This is a beauty too hard to sock away, though it should do well in the cellar another decade or two..
