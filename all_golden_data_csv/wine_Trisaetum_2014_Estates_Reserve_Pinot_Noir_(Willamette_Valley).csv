country: US.
description: The Estates Reserve is a barrel selection combining chosen lots from the three estate vineyards. Despite this vintage's reputation for offering ripe, forward, accessible flavors, this wine remains stubbornly closed. It's entirely possible that it has just hit a bit of a dumb phase, which is not uncommon for recently-bottled Pinot Noir. Ripe full-bodied flavors of strawberry preserves peek through, with moderating acids and no herbal notes..
