country: US.
description: This winery is striving to show that Burgundian varietals can work in the cooler Willow Creek region of Paso Robles, where sea breeze comes through the Templeton Gap. This bottling provides good evidence, with aromas of crushed rocks, vanilla toast, roasted apple and peach. Brisk apple cider dominates the palate, picking up roasted almonds in the midpalate and possessing quite a bit of pear skin grip..
