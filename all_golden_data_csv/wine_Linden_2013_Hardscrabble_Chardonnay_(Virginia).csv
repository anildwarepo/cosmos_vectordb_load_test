country: US.
description: A consistent bottling from an iconic Virginia producer, this vintage is refined in fruit character yet powerful in its focus. Aromas of citrus, sea spray and white button mushroom seem to have been shot through a diffuserâ€”penetrating, broad and refreshing. The medium weight of the palate carries from start to finish along a river of driving acidity, with Meyer lemon, tangy almond cream and lightly toasted praline filling in the midpalate. A resounding note of sea salt lingers on the finish..
