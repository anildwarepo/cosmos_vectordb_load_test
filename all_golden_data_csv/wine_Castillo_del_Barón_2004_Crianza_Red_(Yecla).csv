country: Spain.
description: At first glance it may seem a little saucy, but as it gains its legs this aged Yecla wine shows solid plum, berry and cassis aromas and flavors along with a lively, healthy palate. It's incredibly smooth in the mouth, and definitely ready to go. Spice and chocolate are the finishing touches to what amounts to a nice, warm-climate Mourvèdre.
