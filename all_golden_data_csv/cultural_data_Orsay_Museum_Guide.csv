First Page Reviews: This is a very limited demo, unless you pay. Usability is awful, the audio ""guide"" is an awful robotic voice, app keeps pushing you to unlock the premium version, without telling you what you'll get, and if you do it's just some more robotic voices. worst app ever. it has an automated voice that just reads text. I bought the ""pro"" version and is the same thing. I ended up buying the audio guide at the museum. I want my money back. Having visited the Orsay, this app brings back some great memories. Very well done and easy to use. New discoveries every time!.
