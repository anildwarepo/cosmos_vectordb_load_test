Description: Introduce your babies to birds, cats, dogs, and babies through fine art, illustration, and photographs. These books are a rare opportunity to expose little ones to a range of images on a single subject, from simple child's drawings and abstract art to playful photos. A brief text accompanies each image, introducing the baby to some basic -- and sometimes playful -- information about the subjects..
