description: A favorite within Fox Run's unique geology wine series, an exploration of specific vineyard terroir against specific vinification styles, the 11 Lake Dana Vineyard offers a lovely balance between rustic earth elements and more pristine expressions of fruit and flower. Concentrated tangerine and lemon flavors are honeyed and sweet yet elegantly balanced by tones of black tea, blossom and smoked nut. The finish lingers on a pleasantly astringent note..
