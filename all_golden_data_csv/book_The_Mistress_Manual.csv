Description: Originally published in 1994 in a simple pink guidebook format by an experienced and wickedly creative dominant woman, The Mistress Manual fell out of print when the author moved on to other projects. Now, Greenery Press has brought this underground classic back to life, updated with new ideas and information on 'Learning to Love Command' to 'The Art of Discipline'.
