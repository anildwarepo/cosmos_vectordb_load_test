description: Here's a reserve that really does merit its special designation. Made from 90-year-old vines that likely contain varieties other than Zinfandel, the wine is rich and complex. Delivers all the wild, brambly Zin quality you want, with tiers of blackberries, cherries, cassis, cherry liqueur, tobacco, vanilla and peppery spice flavors that go on and on in the finish. This is an exceptionally well-balanced Zin that's best in its flashy youth..
