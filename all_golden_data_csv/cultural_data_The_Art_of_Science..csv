I am on a Samsung which I would have thought was a common android phone. Is of no use to me so will have to uninstall. very disappointed Does not work at first time but... I was unable to use it on my lg L70 due my font size configuration. To change it you'll need to go to ""display options"" and there change the size font to minimum. It is an amazing app! Beautiful and Impressive Great, but it does not display correctly on my phone. The right edge of each image is cut off when it is displayed, so I can only use about 80% of the screen..
