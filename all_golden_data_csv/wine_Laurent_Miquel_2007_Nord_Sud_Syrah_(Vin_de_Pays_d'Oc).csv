country: France.
description: A gorgeous and decadent Syrah with aromas and flavors of black raspberry, black cherry, fudge brownie and coffee ice cream. The lush and creamy mouth is full but not overdone, with a fantastic evolution on the palate from fresh dark fruit to sweet chocolaty flavors and finally pepper-flecked spice on the long finish. Balanced and read to drink now, though you could hold for another couple of years to mellow..
