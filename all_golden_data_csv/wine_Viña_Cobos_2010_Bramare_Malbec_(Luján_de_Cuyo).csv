country: Argentina.
description: This lush, modern Malbec explodes with power then simmers with complexities. Opaque in color, the bouquet issues intense blackberry, lemon peel, graphite and toast aromas. In the mouth, it's full but not flabby, and then comes an avalanche of black-fruit flavors matched by notes of spice cake, molasses, pepper and mocha. It's warm, toasty and full of licorice on the finish. A superb wine to drink now through 2018..
