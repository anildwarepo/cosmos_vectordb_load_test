country: US.
description: A fascinating feral quality wraps around this wine, redolent of mottled animal hair, raw meat and scraped earth, like the scene of a freshly hunted wild boar. Aromas of mulberry and dark strawberry also show on the nose, while the palate dives deep into turned earth, shiitake mushrooms, juniper, stewed bay leaf, wild cherry and elderflower liqueur. The acidity also pops and the texture grips firmly..
