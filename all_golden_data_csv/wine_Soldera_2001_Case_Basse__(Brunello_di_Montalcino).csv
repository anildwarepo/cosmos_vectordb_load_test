country: Italy.
description: It's safe to say that Gianfranco Soldera's style is only appreciated and understood by Brunello purists. The wines are as thorny and complex as the argumentative, cantankerous man who makes them. For one, this wine has big volatility but the magic here is that those pungent direct aromas translate into bright aromatic vibrancy and buoyancy. In fact, its intensity and the careful balance between acidity and structure is unmatched..
