country: Israel.
description: This classic Bordeaux-style blend—made with 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot—is a stunner now, and it shows the potential to age for another 5–10 years. Black cherry, cassis and wild blackberry notes dominate the nose and mouth, but supporting accents of forest and cigar box spice add depth and interest to the fruit core. Thick and slightly chewy, the dense texture and firm structure promises longevity and additional development to come..
