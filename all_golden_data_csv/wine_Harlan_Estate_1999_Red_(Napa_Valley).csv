country: US.
description: An exceptional wine. Fragrant, with plenty of plum, black cherry, cedar and spice aromas. On the palate, it's silky smooth, elegant and fresh, yet packed with complex layers of blackberry, cassis, chocolate, coffee, anise, sage, thyme and cherry flavors. Marked by an exquisite textural elegance and harmonious balance, it displays a fine blend of firm, supple tannins and appropriate acidty that support great length on the finish..
