country: US.
description: The winery says it can't reveal the source of the grapes, which is odd, but we do know it's in Rutherford. Made from 100% Cab, and aged in 100% new French oak, it is, in a word, splendid. Rich in blackberries, cassis and dark chocolate, the fruit was clearly well grown, and the tannin-acid balance is utterly classic. This beautiful wine is a partnership between three well-known and high-scoring vintners from other brands. It is a winery worth following..
