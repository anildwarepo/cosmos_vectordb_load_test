country: US.
description: As good as the winery's regular 2009 Cabernet is, this small-production selection from the estate vineyard is even better. However, as the tannins are fierce, it's not a wine you want to drink anytime soon. Through the astringency shines a bright, burning core of perfectly ripe blackberries and savory black currants. Flashy and impressive, this 100% Cabernet should begin to soften and mellow after 2018..
