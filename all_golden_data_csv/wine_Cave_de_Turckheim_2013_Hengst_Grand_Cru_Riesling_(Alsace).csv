country: France.
description: A touch of earth and the purest expression possible of tart ripe red apple immediately draws you in on the nose. The absolutely dry palate also has a touch of that earthiness and adds more apple-peel notions to the fruit while a vivid lemon brightness takes center stage. This is generous and earthy in a typically Alsatian idiom but then that freshness kicks in and takes this to another level. It channels and guides all the energy and power of this site into alluring dynamics on the palate. The finish is dry, long and lovely. Drink 2017–2030..
