country: France.
description: Very fruity, very juicy, this wine is all about crisp, fresh fruitiness, starting with hand-picked biodynamic vineyard plots and gravity-flow into the winery. Red currants dominate, with considerable acidity right at the fore. At the back, the tannins are developing, but fruit will be the hallmark for the long future. Owner Thierry Valette's family also owns Château Troplong-Mondot in Saint-Émilion..
