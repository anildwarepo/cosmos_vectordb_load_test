wine_Miguel_Torres_1999_Cordillera_Red_(Curicó_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 68002.
country: Chile.
description: A blend of old-vine Cariñena (60%), Syrah (25%) and Merlot (15%). The color is impressively dark and so is the fruit—mainly plums and blackberries. Toast and dried spices from new oak give an additional impression of opulence. But even more impressive is the balance. This is no low-acid, fruit-and-oak wonder; the natural acidity of the Carignane shines through, giving lift and definition to the flavors. Easy to drink now, but should easily hold a few years..
