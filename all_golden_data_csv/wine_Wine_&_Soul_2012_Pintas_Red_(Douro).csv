description: The original vineyard owned by winemaking husband and wife Jorge Borges and Sandra Tavares da Silva, this is halfway up the Pinh√£o Valley, close to some of the greatest Douro vineyards. Pintas is now well established as a Douro classic. It is powered by tannins at this stage, but the structure, the lush fruit that comes from fermentation in open lagars and the sheer density of the wine, speak of greatness. Drink from 2019..
