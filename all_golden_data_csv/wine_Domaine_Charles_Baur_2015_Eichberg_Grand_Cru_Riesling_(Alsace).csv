country: France.
description: A shy, just about citrus-scented nose takes a little air to be woken up before releasing a strikingly pure note of ripe lemon. The palate has the same clear lemon purity but has a rich fluid texture of ripeness and concentration—a wonderful interplay of fruit richness and taut freshness that creates tension and poise. While the palate is completely dry, the lemon depth attains the richness of lemon oil and candied zest. The tanginess lingers long on the pure finish. This is lovely and pure now, but bottle age will make it beguiling. Drink 2017–2037..
