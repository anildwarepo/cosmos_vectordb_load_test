country: France.
description: This is a seriously dry wine. Arnaud Margaine works each harvest to create freshness and a totally crisp texture, generally dismissing malolactic fermentation. It is balanced, allowing the fruitiness to shine through the tight, mineral texture from the predominant Chardonnay in the blend that comes from a mere 16-acre Montaigne de Reims vineyard surrounded by Pinot Noir. It could age through 2015 in bottle to be even better..
