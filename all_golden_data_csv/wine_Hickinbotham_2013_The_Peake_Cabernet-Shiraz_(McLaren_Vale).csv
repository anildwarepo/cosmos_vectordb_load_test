wine_Hickinbotham_2013_The_Peake_Cabernet-Shiraz_(McLaren_Vale),"Unnamed: 0: 59977.
country: Australia.
description: This is a top example of the classic Australian blend. Cabernet (57%) provides cigar box aromas and elongates the finish, while Shiraz (43%) fills out the midpalate. The combination is full-bodied yet muscular, generous yet firmly structured. Essence of cassis is framed by hints of vanilla and cedar, while the long finish shows off chewy tannins and mouthwatering acids. Drink 2023â€“2035, and posssibly beyond..
