Description: ""This is no small achievement. For the language-lover the translation provides elegant, flowing English verse, for the classicist it conveys close approximation to the Latin meaning coupled with a sense of the movement and rhythmic variety of Ovid's language""--Geraldine Herbert-Brown, editor of Ovid's Fasti: Historical Readings at its Bimillennium ""This book fills a gap. There is no similar annotated English translation of Ovid's exile poetry. Thoroughly grounded in Ovidian scholarship, Green's introduction and notes are helpful and informative. The translation is accurate, idiomatic, and lively, closely imitating the Latin elegiac couplet and capturing Ovid's changing moods.""--Karl Galinsky, author of Ovid's Metamorphoses: An Introduction to the Basic Aspects.
