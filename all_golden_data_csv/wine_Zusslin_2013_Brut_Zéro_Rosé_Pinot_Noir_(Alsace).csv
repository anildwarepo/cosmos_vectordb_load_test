country: France.
description: The faintest note of caramel precedes hints of baked red apples. This is soft and generous, mellow and smooth, supported by very fine mousse and pervaded by subtle freshness. All the structure and richness of Pinot Noir are evident in this elegant rosé. Its purity and poise is outstanding, its flavors linger and last. This is immensely rich yet slender: clearly the art of zero-dosage has been mastered here completely..
