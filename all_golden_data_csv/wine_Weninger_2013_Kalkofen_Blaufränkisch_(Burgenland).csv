wine_Weninger_2013_Kalkofen_Blaufränkisch_(Burgenland),"Unnamed: 0: 82713.
country: Austria.
description: Sonorous oak notes in vain seek to calm down the peppery exuberance of blueberry. There are forests of spice tucked behind the gentle, ripe fruit that has the equally tart and aromatic nature of wild little bilberries. The tannins are juicy while very dense. This is full of life and energy: invigorating now but with the potential to develop through 2020. The impression of bilberry really lasts and lasts..
