wine_Domaines_Schlumberger_2014_Cuvée_Eric_Riesling_(Alsace),"Unnamed: 0: 32253.
country: France.
description: Preserved mandarins are evoked on the nose. The palate continues this rich and luscious but zesty citrus game: tangerine, clementine and orange weave their sweet-tart aromatic course across the palate and into your heart. This has lovely richness but not an ounce of fat. Streamlined Riesling freshness bathes rich late harvest sweetness in bright refreshing light. The zesty finish makes you crave more. Drink now through 2030..
