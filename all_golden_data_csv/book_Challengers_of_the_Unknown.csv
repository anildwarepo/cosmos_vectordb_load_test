Description: Five extraordinary people with seemingly nothing in common share the bond of surviving a cataclysmic event. In a world devoid of super-heroes, they will come together and discover that all they know has been a lie--that the world we live in is not the one we believe it to be. To survive they must unite and face the true masters of our universe. It's a world where literally anything can happen, and probably will--as if living on borrowed time wasn't enough!.
