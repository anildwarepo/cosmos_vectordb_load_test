country: New Zealand.
description: This special Sauvignon Blanc is only being released in top vintages. The first was the 2010; the 2013 is the second vintage. Fermented in oak, it offers up complex aromas of pencil shavings and grapefruit, followed by hints of toast, cedar, red currants and gooseberries. It's a ripe, weighty style, but it carries those traits without a hitch, gliding seamlessly through a long, silky, mouthwatering finish..
