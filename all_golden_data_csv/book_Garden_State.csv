Description: This first novel by the acclaimed author of Demonology and The Ice Storm traces a group of friends in Haledon, New Jersey, through one Spring in their rocky passage towards adulthood. The kids are out of school, trying to start a band, trying to find work; looking for something to do within the degraded terrain of their suburban hometown. Garden State starkly captures the lyricism of their lives in an intense and unforgettable story of friendship and betrayal..
