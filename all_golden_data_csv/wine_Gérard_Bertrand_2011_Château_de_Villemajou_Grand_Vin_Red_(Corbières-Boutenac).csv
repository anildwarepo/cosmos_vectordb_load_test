country: France.
description: Concentrated and powerfully structured now, this will benefit from some time to integrate and harmonize. Currently, all of the elements are assertively upfront, with strong oaky sensations, dense and ripe black-fruit notes and firm tannins all vying for your attention. Hints of leather, bramble, licorice root and roasted cocoa nib hang in the background, waiting for their moment to shine. Try after 2016, and through 2020..
