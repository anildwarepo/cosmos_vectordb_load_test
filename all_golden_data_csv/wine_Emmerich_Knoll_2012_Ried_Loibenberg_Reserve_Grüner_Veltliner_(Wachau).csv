country: Austria.
description: Lusciously ripe, almost honeyed, pear fruit emanates from the glass. Underneath that is grapefruit zest and pith and a herbal, stony, earthy edge. The palate is rich and curvaceous but completely toned by a pervasive, lemony acidity that lends drive and linearity. This is already approachable, which is not to say that it doesn't promise a lot of mileage: this will go on and unfold its facets of fruit. Immense charm almost plays over the fact that this is a very age-worthy wine, with a finish that's almost endless. Drink from 2017..
