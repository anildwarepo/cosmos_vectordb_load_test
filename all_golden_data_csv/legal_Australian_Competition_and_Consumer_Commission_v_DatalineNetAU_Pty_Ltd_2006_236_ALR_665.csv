case_title: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.Net.AU Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 665.
case_text: is not to say that the receipt of evidence is precluded on an application for default judgment under O 35A. Prior authority establishes that additional evidence consistent with a party's case as pleaded in the statement of claim may be considered with respect to the relief sought: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline Net AU Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 665 (Kiefel J (affirmed Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline.Net.AU Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 146 ; (2007) 161 FCR 513) (Dataline). In Dataline , Kiefel J also noted of O 35A that: The statement of claim alleges numerous contraventions of s 16(1) and s 16(9) of the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) (Spam Act). It further alleges contraventions by the First and Second Respondents of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) with the Fourth, Fifth and Seventh Respondents being alleged to be parties to these corporate contraventions. Albeit at the risk of over-generalisation, the conduct alleged may be summarised as the deceptive use of fabricated profiles on dating websites in order to obtain mobile telephone numbers for the purpose of sending or causing to be sent unsolicited commercial electronic messages to the unsuspecting telephone account holders. Yet, further conduct alleged involves the sending of unsolicited commercial electronic messages which purport to supply a ""single club"" or ""fantasy chat"" service to unsuspecting telephone account holders. So far as the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth and Seventh Respondents are concerned, I am satisfied that the statement of claim alleges contraventions known to law of the Spam Act and the Trade Practices Act and which enliven the Court's jurisdiction to grant declaratory and injunctive relief. I am further satisfied that the injunctive relief sought is not merely a bland recitation of statutory prohibitions but rather has been framed with sufficient precision to enable the Respondents concerned to identify the conduct which is the subject of restraint and so as to permit ready identification of an event of default. The declarations sought are in these terms: Declarations concerning contraventions of the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) A declaration that the first respondent, whose central management and control was in Australia, by sending short message service (""SMS"") messages or causing SMS messages to be sent via 19773366 and 19910006 to Australian mobile telephone numbers, which it had obtained by deception using fabricated dating website profiles, for the purpose of dishonestly obtaining the account holders' acceptance of its Safe Divert service, has engaged in conduct in contravention of s.16(1) of the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) .
