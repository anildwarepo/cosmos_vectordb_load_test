wine_Le_Chiuse_2012__Brunello_di_Montalcino,"Unnamed: 0: 15844.
country: Italy.
description: Dark-skinned berry, forest floor, pipe tobacco, new leather and balsamic notes float out of the glass. On the elegantly structured palate, taut, polished tannins and vibrant acidity frame ripe red cherry, exotic spice and aromatic herb flavors. A lingering star anise note announces the close. Impeccably balanced and loaded with class, it's still young and needs time to fully develop. Drink 2022–2037..
