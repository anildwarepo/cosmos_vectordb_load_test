title: The Shepherd and the Lion.
text: The Fable Æsop tells is nearly this:—A shepherd from his flock began to miss,And long’d to catch the stealer of, his sheep.Before a cavern, dark and deep,Where wolves retired by day to sleep,Which he suspected as the thieves,He set his trap among the leaves;And, ere he left the place,He thus invoked celestial grace:—“O king of all the powers divine,Against the rogue but grant me this delight,That this my trap may catch him in my sight,And I, from twenty calves of mine,Will make the fattest thine.”But while the words were on his tongue,Forth came a lion great and strong.Down crouch’d the man of sheep, and said,With shivering fright half dead,“Alas! that man should never be awareOf what may be the meaning of his prayer!To catch the robber of my flocks,O king of gods, I pledged a calf to thee:If from his clutches thou wilt rescue me,I’ll raise my offering to an ox.”.
