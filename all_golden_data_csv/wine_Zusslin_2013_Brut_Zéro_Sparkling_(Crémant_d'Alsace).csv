country: France.
description: Notes of fresh sourdough rye bread, crisp apples and citrus vie for attention and signal an evolved wine with beautiful notes of long autolysis. This is borne out on the exquisitely pure and fresh palate, still sprightly with lemon and green-apple freshness against a background of bread crust and crumb. Over time, the apple notes mellow and are reminiscent of spiced winter apple. This is marked by exquisite elegance and purity. Without any dosage, this shines with pure, intense and lively fruit..
