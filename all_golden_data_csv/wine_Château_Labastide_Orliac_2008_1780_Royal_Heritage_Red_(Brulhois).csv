description: The old vines from this estate that has been run by the same family for 10 generations have produced a firm wine, with structure and tannins that still need to soften. It is rich and juicy with black fruits and wood aging toastiness. The wine, named after the 1780 Royal Edict that established this small appellation on the banks of the Garonne river between Bordeaux and Toulouse is worth aging longer, so wait to drink until 2018..
