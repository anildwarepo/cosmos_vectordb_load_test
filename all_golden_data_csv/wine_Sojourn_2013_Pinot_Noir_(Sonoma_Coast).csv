country: US.
description: Clear in color and texture, this is a refined and yet voluptuous wine, a blend from several of the producer's single-vineyard designates, from Ridgetop Vineyard near Annapolis to Gap's Crown within the Petaluma Gap. It works on several levels, retaining the acidity of the cooler sites while combining the deeper, more complex aspects of others. Expect dark cherry and blueberry along a foundation of earthy truffle..
