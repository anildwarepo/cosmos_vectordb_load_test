description: Produced from organically grown grapes, this wood-aged wine from the Dupuy family is rich and full, packed with black plum and ripe berry flavors. With 30% Cabernet Franc in the blend, the wine is perfumed and structured with a smoky aftertaste that is balanced by acidity. Drink this well-made wine from 2017. The vineyard was certified organic in 1996, early in Bordeaux terms, and is managed by Gérard Dupuy..
