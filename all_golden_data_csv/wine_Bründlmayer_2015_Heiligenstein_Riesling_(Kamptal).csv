country: Austria.
description: An earthy dimension still clings to the zesty notes on the nose but on the palate a whole load of citrus flavors are expressed without strain: For now, lemon and the tangy zest of tangerine carry everything on this slender but concentrated wine to a glorious, totally refreshing finish. This is the glory of youth but with such purity and bundled energy this has a long, promising and decidedly delicious future. Drink 2016–2036..
