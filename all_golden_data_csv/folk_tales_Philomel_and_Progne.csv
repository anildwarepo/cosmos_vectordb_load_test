title: Philomel and Progne.
text: From home and city spires, one day,The swallow Progne flew away,And sought the bosky dellWhere sang poor Philomel.“My sister,” Progne said, “how do you do?‘Tis now a thousand years since youHave been conceal’d from human view;I’m sure I have not seen your faceOnce since the times of Thrace.Pray, will you never quit this dull retreat?”“Where could I find,” said Philomel, “so sweet?”“What! sweet?” cried Progne—”sweet to wasteSuch tones on beasts devoid of tasteOr on some rustic, at the most!Should you by deserts be engross’d?Come, be the city’s pride and boast.Besides, the woods remind of harmsThat Tereus in them did your charms.”“Alas!” replied the bird of song,“The thought of that so cruel wrongMakes me, from age to age,Prefer this hermitage;For nothing like the sight of menCan call up what I suffer’d then.”.
