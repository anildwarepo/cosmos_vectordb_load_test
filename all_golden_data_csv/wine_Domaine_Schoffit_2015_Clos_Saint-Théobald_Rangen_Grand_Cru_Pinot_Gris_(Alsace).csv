country: France.
description: The pithy, appetizing notion of russet pear peel entices on the nose, alongside the juicy ripeness of yellow pears. The palate has a rich earthy profound juiciness where generous pear fruit is countered by a pleasantly bitter edge. Notions of sandalwood spice glint in the distance. There is something warming, powerful and generous about this rich wine but the finish remains dry. This will benefit from bottle age. Drink 2020–2035..
