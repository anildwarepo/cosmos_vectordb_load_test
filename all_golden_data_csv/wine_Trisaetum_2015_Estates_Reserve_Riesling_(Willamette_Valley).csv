country: US.
description: This tops a thoroughly outstanding lineup of eight estate-grown Rieslings from Trisaetum. Unctuous citrus and stone fruits abound: a luscious mix of Meyer lemon, pink grapefruit, peach and apricot. There are hints of honey, caramel and butter, and everything is tightened up by defining acidity. Though entirely ageworthy, this is so thoroughly delicious already you'll want to drink at least a bottle or two immediately. Drink now through 2035..
