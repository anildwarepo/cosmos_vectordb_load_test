country: US.
description: It's impossible to imagine this wine could have existed even five years ago, even though it hails from the extraordinary Nielson Vineyard that for many years has yielded Byron's best Pinot Noirs, as well as Chardonnays. The ripeness level is something only modern techniques could achieve, and the 2007 vintage was great. Ultrarich in blackberries, cherries and dark chocolate, the wine retains a silky texture and is imposingly full-bodied. Drink nowâ€“2013..
