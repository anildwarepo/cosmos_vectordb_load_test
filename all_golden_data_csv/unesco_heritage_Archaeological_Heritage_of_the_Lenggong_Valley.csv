unesco_heritage_Archaeological_Heritage_of_the_Lenggong_Valley,"Name: Archaeological Heritage of the Lenggong Valley.
short_description: <p>Situated in the lush Lenggong Valley, the property includes four archaeological sites in two clusters which span close to 2Â million years, one of the longest records of early man in a single locality, and the oldest outside the African continent. It features open-air and cave sites with Palaeolithic tool workshops, evidence of early technology. The number of sites found in the relatively contained area suggests the presence of a fairly large, semi-sedentary population with cultural remains from the Palaeolithic, Neolithic and Metal ages.</p>.
