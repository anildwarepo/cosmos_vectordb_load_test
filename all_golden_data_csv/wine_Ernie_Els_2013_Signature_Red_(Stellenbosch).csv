country: South Africa.
description: A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec, this is a bold, concentrated and flavorful wine that will mature well over the next 10 years. Aromas of espresso, cr√®me de cassis, spiced blackberry, boysenberry preserves, tobacco and woodspice abound and carry through to the robust, gripping palate. It's firmly structured, but harmonious in it's overall strength, with final notes of campfire, char and cocoa on the long finish..
