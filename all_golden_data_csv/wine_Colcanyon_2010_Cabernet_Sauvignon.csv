country: US.
description: From a winery that holds back its few hundred-case production each year comes a very promising Old World-styled wine grown in the rocky terroir of the Malibu Coast. Amidst its dark blueberry and crushed graphite scents are dried pasilla chile, nettle and pine hints. The palate shows similar savory and herbal touches, with green peppercorn accenting ripe red cherry and clove, all framed by firm tannins..
