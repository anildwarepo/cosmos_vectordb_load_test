country: US.
description: Yes, even for a California Pinot, this is a big, strong, full-bodied wine. Southing always is. It could almost morph into a Cabernet Sauvignon. But who cares? It's compellingly delicious, and isn't that what wine is all about? Flavorwise, it tastes of cherries, oranges, red currants, violets, raspberries, cedar and peppery spices, with 65% new oak. The tannins will help carry it across the finish line by 2012 or so..
