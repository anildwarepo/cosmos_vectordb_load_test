They have a solid track record, going back for years, of wrestling the wine's difficulties into elegant submission. With the 2012 vintage, Foxen has crafted one of their best ever. It's dry, moderate in alcohol and crisp in acidity, with complex peach, citrus, green apple, wax bean and herb flavors..
