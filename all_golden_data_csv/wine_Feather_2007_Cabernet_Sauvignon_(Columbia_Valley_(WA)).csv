country: US.
description: Pure Cabernet, aged in the same Vicard barrels as winemaker Randy Dunn's Howell Mountain wines. About 90% is new oak, but it doesn't strangle the fruit in any way. Tart and vibrant, with black cherry/black currant fruit, this balanced effort shows a velvety character and a fine touch in the vineyard. Nuances of coffee, earth, leaf and dried herb are threaded through, in perfect harmony and balanced for medium-term aging..
