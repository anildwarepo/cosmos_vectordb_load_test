wine_Sierra_Cantabria_2010_Reserva__(Rioja),"Unnamed: 0: 113880.
country: Spain.
description: Crisp, toasty oak and spice aromas are currently outranking this wine's berry-fruit components...but only for now. In five or more years, this will be less oaky and more complex. At this point in time, look for a sinewy, tight, almost jagged palate with toasty, robust flavors of plum and berry, dry spices and mixed herbs along with firm tannins. A long, balanced finish bodes well for the future. Drink through 2030..
