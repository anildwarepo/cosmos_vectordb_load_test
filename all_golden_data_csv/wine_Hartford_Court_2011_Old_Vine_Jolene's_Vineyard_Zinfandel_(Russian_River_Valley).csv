country: US.
description: If you're tired of Zinfandels that are unabalanced and inelegant, try this one. Yes, the alcohol is high, but it folds perfectly into everything else. The vineyard is in the Olivet Road part of the valley, which in many ways represents the ideal terroir of the Russian River. You'll find brisk acidity and firm tannins in this wine, but also ripely appealing blackberry, cherry, cola and briary wild chamomile flavors. This seriously good wine will age until 2022..
