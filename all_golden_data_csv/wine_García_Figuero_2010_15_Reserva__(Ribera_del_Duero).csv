country: Spain.
description: García Figuero had a great year in 2010, as did many high-end Ribera del Duero wineries. This reserva is heady up front, with malty aromas of vanilla, barrel resin, tobacco, blackberry and cassis. This is huge but holds onto its balance, while flavors of baked black fruits come with vanilla, coffee, mocha and chocolate accents. This modern marvel finishes with vanilla, pepper and chocolate flavors on top of lasting black currant and blackberry. Drink through 2025..
