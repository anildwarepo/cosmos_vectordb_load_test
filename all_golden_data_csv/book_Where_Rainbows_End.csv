Description: The new warm and absorbing story from the author of PS, I LOVE YOU is a bittersweet tale of childhood friends Rosie and Alex whose relationship must survive many trials and tribulations, not least the discovery of their true feelings for one another.From naughty children to rebellious teenagers and mixed-up twenty- and thirty-somethings, Rosie and Alex have stuck by each other through thick and thin, even when Alex moved across the Atlantic to Boston and Rosie fell pregnant as a teenager. Alex supportsRosie through one of the most difficult times of her life -- a time when she should be out partying and going to university but is instead changing nappies and coping with a screaming baby. In return, Rosie is there for Alex when he strugglesthrough his medical internship and copes with a messy divorce. Throughout the ups and downs of each other's lives, they have remained a constant, a shoulder to cry on, someone to laugh and share their innermost feelings with.But can their friendship survive the years and the miles and, more critically, when they each marry someone else? Were they meant to be more than just good friends all along? Misunderstandings, circumstances and sheer bad luck.
