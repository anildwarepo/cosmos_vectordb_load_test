wine_Il_Marroneto_2012_Madonna_delle_Grazie__(Brunello_di_Montalcino),"Unnamed: 0: 122936.
country: Italy.
description: Perfumed berry, rose, new leather and dark spice are some of the enticing scents you'll find in this vibrant wine. It's still tightly wound but already dazzles with juicy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, nutmeg and pipe tobacco flavors. Youthfully austere but noble tannins and bright acidity provide balance and serious aging potential. Don't be tempted to open it soon—the best is yet to come. Drink 2022–2042..
