Also some of the audio guides were under different names and locations than the narrators stated. However overall it was an excellent guide and very much enhanced our experience. Plus it was a good free alternative to the expensive audio and live tours for purchase at the museum. 100 audio clips are stored as 1 file rather that 100,so download was reset if I lost wi-fi connection or phone screen locked. No option to download text only. Took over 30 mins on 5th attempt, totally wasting my time in the museum. App needs better design to minimise these problems. The order of the audio does not match with the order of progress through the building, so you hear content that does not match up with where you are. Very confusing. Stopped using it after a couple of segments. Worked sporadically on a Nokia 6, but not on a Pixel 3. Think it might require cellular data to view, but even then was unreliable..
