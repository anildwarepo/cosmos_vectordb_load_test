country: Austria.
description: The nose is still dominated by funky yeast, signaling that this Riesling requires time in bottle. The streamlined palate reveals something that is equally generous and tart, like pink grapefruit or pomelo. There is a lovely phenolic texture, too, with intimations of riper fruit in the background that will still take their time to appear. Best to let this slumber for a while in a cool cellar. Drink as of 2018..
