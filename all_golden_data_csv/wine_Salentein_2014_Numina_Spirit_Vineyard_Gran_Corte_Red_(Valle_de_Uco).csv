country: Argentina.
description: Salentein's wines have never been better than over the last few vintages. This Malbec-heavy blend is rich, with aromatic notes of raisin, prune, licorice and almond candy. A full, tannic and slightly bumpy palate holds impressive flavors of cassis, black plum, blackberry, toast and peppercorn. On the finish, coffee, toast, mocha, licorice and cassis flavors are deep and delicious. Drink through 2026..
