country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Rianie Strydom. A blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Shiraz, this is currently young and tight, with clamped aromas and flavors of cassis, blackberry, licorice, leather and black tea leaves. It's gripping and firmly structured, with aggressive tannins that linger long on the dry finish, alongside notes of toasted wood, espresso grinds and black cherry skin. Try after 2020 and through 2025..
