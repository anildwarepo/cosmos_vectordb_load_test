country: France.
description: Wet stone and lemon set the tone when it comes to scent. The palate falls in with these themes and presents precision and poise; the razor-sharp freshness of lemon zest is both brightening and deliciously bracing. This is a svelte but concentrated wine of great purity that has not really come into its own yet. It is perfumed now but one cannot help but suspect much more development of aroma in the future. All the potential, concentration and balance is there. The finish is dry and lemony. Drink 2017–2030..
