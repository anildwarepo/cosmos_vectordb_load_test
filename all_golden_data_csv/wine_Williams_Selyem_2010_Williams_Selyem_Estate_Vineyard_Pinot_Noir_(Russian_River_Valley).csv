description: This shows the extraordinary richness and complexity that the winery's estate vineyard has exhibited over its lifetime. It's vast in cherry, red currant and licorice flavors, plus multiple layers of saut√©ed mushroom, exotic baking spice, mineral and sweet, smoky sandalwood. It's also very tannic, with a brisk spine of acidity. Good as it is, it needs time for all the parts to knit together. Better after 2018..
