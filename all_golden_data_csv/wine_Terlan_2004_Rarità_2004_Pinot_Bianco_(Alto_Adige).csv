description: Aged on its lees for over 10 years, this stunning wine shows the extraordinary aging potential of Pinot Bianco in Alto Adige. It boasts enticing scents of ripe orchard fruit, vanilla, graphite and a whiff of oak that carry over to the radiant palate along with ripe apple, candied lemon drop and nectarine zest. Bright acidity lends balance while a flinty mineral note backs up the lingering finish. Loaded with finesse and complexity, it's simply gorgeous..
