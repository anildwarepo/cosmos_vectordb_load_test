country: Austria.
description: For now, very restrained oak dominates the nose. Wafts of soft smokiness create the impression of a cloud within which red fruit slumbers. This is youthful and comes with a smoky backbone of a structure—a beautiful faultline of fresh acidity. To appropriate a well-used metaphor, this is like a firm handshake from a hand gloved in vermilion velvet. With some time, tender notes of morello cherry tantalizingly appear. This should come with an addiction warning for lovers of elegant Pinots. Drink 2017–2025..
