country: Austria.
description: Savory hints of moss and lime, of fragrant, crushed citrus foliage and very pure lemon zest make for a totally seductive nose. How this can have all the fragrant promise of the coast when it is from landlocked Austria is anyone's guess. The palate is concentrated, streamlined and presents a panoply of zesty citrus notes: mandarin and lemon peel one moment, lime and grapefruit the next. Totally charming in its youth, this really is made for the long run. Drink 2016–2030 at least..
