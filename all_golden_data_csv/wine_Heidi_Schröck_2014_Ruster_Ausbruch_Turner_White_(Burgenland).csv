country: Austria.
description: On the nose, a blast of beeswax and honey provides heady lift. The palate is tooth-breakingly sweet but comes with that honeyed, candied-citrus thrill. Sufficient bright acidity counters all the richness. The mouthfeel is full, oily and viscous, always with that honeycomb and beeswax note, not quite tipping into the savoriness of maple syrup. Despite all the decadent sweetness, the finish is still lip-smacking, clean and endless..
