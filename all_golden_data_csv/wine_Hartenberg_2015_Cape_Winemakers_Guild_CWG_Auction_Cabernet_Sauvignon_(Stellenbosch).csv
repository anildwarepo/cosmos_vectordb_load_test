country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Carl Schultz. This is one well-balanced Cab, aged for 19 months in 75% new and 25% second fill French oak. It's warm and spicy upfront, leading with pleasant aromas of brambly berry compote, cassis, licorice root, charred tree bark and a touch of chocolate brownie. The palate is soft and smooth on entry, with rich, concentrated black-fruit flavors, but structured tannins pick up and lend serious grip to the long, spicy finish. A wine that should continue to develop well, drink 2021â€“2025..
