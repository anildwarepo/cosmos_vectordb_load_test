country: US.
description: A high-elevation vineyard (1,700-feet) above Boonville, Deer Meadows imparts a subtle floral violet quality to this wine, which is lovingly faint in color and silky texture. Over time, the perfume builds into a singularly resolved mélange of dark blueberry and tart cherry, the acidity perfectly able to hit the high notes. This wine should be enjoyable through 2021–2024 minimum, making an incredible partner to mushroom risotto or spring lamb..
