country: Italy.
description: Fermented in clay amphora, this fascinating orange wine opens with alluring aromas of dried yellow stone fruit, baking spice, aromatic herb, pressed yellow flower and a balsamic note. Boasting more fruit and flavor than many other wines in this genre, the savory enveloping palate presents apricot, yellow peach, candied nectarine zest, crystallized ginger and a hint of flinty mineral. Tangy acidity provides balance and lift while a honeyed note closes the lingering finish. Simply gorgeous..
