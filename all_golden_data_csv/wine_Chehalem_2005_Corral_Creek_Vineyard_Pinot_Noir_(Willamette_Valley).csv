country: US.
description: A single-vineyard wine from Oregon can be a component rather than a complete wine, but here it is an absolute joy. Fragrant and complex, this offers pleasures for both nose and palate, with scents of leaf and spice and herb, leading into a surprisingly dense and textural blend of wild berry, rhubarb, melon and mixed tropical fruits. Fascinating and long, this is a fine example of Oregon Pinot at its most elegant and fascinating..
