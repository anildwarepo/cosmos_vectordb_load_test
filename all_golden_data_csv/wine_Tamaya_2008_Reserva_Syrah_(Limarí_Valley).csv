wine_Tamaya_2008_Reserva_Syrah_(Limarí_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 46643.
country: Chile.
description: Quite the floral wine, with blueberry and violet aromas that distinguish it from others. But the palate is sharp and choppy, with high acidity that lends sharpness to the black cherry and raspberry flavors. Stirs interest because it breaks the mold of heavy, black fruit-dominated Syrahs. But it's also strange and not fully in gear. Imported by Ecovalley Quality Wine Group and National Refrescos Import Company, LLC..
