country: Australia.
description: The rich blackberry, vanilla and toast nose sets you up for a lush, supple wine and this one does not disappoint. Full and dense, it offers rich black-cherry and cassis flavors on the palate, and a huge finish with fine-grained tannins. Very well poised for its size, it's approachable now. Nevertheless, it will be much more nuanced and show more finesse in 5â€“8 years. Keep for a decade or two, maybe more. To be released 5/01..
