country: US.
description: Dark, bold, potent and young are just a few words to describe this Cabernet, which contains a splash of Petit Verdot and Malbec. Shows concentrated blackberry, black currant and violet flavors that turn sweet and chocolaty on the finish, although the wine itself is perfectly dry. Quite tannic, which suggests ageability, although high alcohol of 15.5% will be controversial in some circles. Best after 2013, in a proper cellar..
