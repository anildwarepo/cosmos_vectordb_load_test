wine_Sleight_of_Hand_2012_Levitation_Syrah_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 36162.
country: US.
description: Hailing mostly from renowned Les Collines (44%) and Lewis (41%) vineyards and rounded out by up-and-comer Stoney Vine, this wine isn't fully ready to reveal its aromatic charms. Notes of dried herb, green olive, licorice, earth and boysenberry are out in front of brooding blue and red fruit. The flavors, however, are in full bloom, with palate-coating, focused and almost creamy cherry and plum notes that persist on the finish..
