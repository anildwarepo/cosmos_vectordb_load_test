description: Farrell's Starr Ridge Dijon bottling is a fruity wine, bright and forward in red and black cherry, black raspberry, licorice and cola flavors, with smoky oak elaborations and a floral scent of violets. All that richness is balanced with crisp acids and even a dusting of fine tannins. Brilliant and pure, this Pinot should provide fine drinking through the age of six years or more, depending on how you like your older wines..
