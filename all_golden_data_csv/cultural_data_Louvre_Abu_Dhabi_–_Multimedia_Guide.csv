First Page Reviews: Such a non-professional developer! How could they implement a 2 5 gb download without a progress bar and notification. The app just dies when going to background Very poor. No content, slow, bad UI and UX. Abu Dhabi can do so much better... Literally useless. Cannot load anything. Please change the the language option in the app so I can choose it from within the app not based on my system language setting..
