country: US.
description: Grapes are meticulously sourced from a range of sites, including Sonoma Mountain and Knights Valley on the Sonoma side, and Spottswoode estate, Hyde and Ink Grade from Napa. Opening with the aromas of grassy knoll, it develops in the glass to show juicy, fresh acidity and well-defined flavors of apricot and wet stone. Young and bright, the acidity is tenacious and supportive, making way for a final lilt of creaminess on the finish..
