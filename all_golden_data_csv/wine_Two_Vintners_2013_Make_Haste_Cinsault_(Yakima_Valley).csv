country: US.
description: This is a rare, 100% varietal Cinsault from Olsen Vineyard that saw only neutral French oak, and it's hard to imagine a more pure representation of the variety. Aromas of tart red fruit and flowers with high-toned stem accents are followed by piercingly pure, elegantly styled fruit and savory flavors that undulate across the palate. The balance is exquisite. It stands up beautifully on its own but will truly sing at the dinner table. Pair it with lamb..
