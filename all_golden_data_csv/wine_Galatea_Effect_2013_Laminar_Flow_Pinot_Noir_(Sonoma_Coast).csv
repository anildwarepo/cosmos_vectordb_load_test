country: US.
description: Encased in what seems to be the world's biggest bottle, this wine made by Jeff Cohn telegraphs excess on several fronts, from its price to its suggestion to decant one to two hours prior to enjoying, to its ripe strawberry jam sensibilities. Voluptuously big-boned and spicy, given 100% new French oak and a fair amount of whole cluster fermentation, it'll appeal to fans of frothy exuberance and may well be best after time in cellar, through 2018..
