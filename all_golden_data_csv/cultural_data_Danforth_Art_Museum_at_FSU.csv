Application Description: ""An exciting digital museum companion to enhance your experience of what our guests have repeatedly called “a gem of a museum.” Explore the Danforth Art Museum’s permanent collection and rotating exhibitions with interesting tours, chats with the Curator, a gallery map, plus educational video and audio clips. Our app also offers visitors access to works of art not currently on display in the Museum and provides in-depth explanations of Boston Expressionism and various art terms. The Danforth Art Museum’s Permanent Collection, containing over 3,500 objects, focuses on American art from the early 19th century to the present day. Changing exhibitions feature both historical and contemporary works and emphasize the Museum’s commitment to contemporary, regional artists in all media. A highlight of the Permanent Collection is the work of Meta Vaux Warrick Fuller, a twentieth century African-American sculptor whose works address contemporary issues of race, gender, and social justice. The Museum houses the contents of Fuller’s Framingham studio, which include almost 400 pieces detailing her process in a gallery devoted to the artist.The Danforth Art Museum is proud to be part of Framingham State University. The Danforth Museum mobile app was made possible by funding from the Massachusetts Cultural Council.""Read moreCollapse.
