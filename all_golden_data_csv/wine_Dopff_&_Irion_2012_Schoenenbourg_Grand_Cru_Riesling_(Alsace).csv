country: France.
description: That ethereal herbal lift of fine Riesling is apparent with the very first whiff. These wonderfully herb-scented notions continue on the exemplary dry palate: Imagine a lick of scented, dried chamomile embracing notions of dried and fresh apple and citrus peel. A wonderfully harmonious synthesis of fresh and evolved flavors. If you need convincing of the mature charm of Riesling this is the wine to convince you: Elegant, understated and yet intense. The finish is dry, sustained and utterly moreish. Lovely and maturing now, but with further potential. Drink 2017–2030..
