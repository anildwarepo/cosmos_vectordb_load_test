description: As in 2014, this budget label from Paul O'Brien winery is a stunning value in an Oregon Pinot Noir. A total of 20% of the fruit was sourced from the Willamette Valley, and all was barrel aged for 10 months in 25% new French oak. Concentrated raspberry and cherry fruit is complemented with streaks of earth and bark. The texture is compelling, and the stiff tannins will continue to soften up over the next decade or so..
