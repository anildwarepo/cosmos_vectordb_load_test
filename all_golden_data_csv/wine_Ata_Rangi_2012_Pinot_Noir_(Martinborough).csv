description: This looks to be among the best vintages for this wine, or at least it's one of the most flattering to taste young. Stunning floral notes emerge from the glass, wrapped in ripe black-cherry scents. On the palate, it's slightly plummier, but still retains those exciting rose-petal nuances and folds in hints of spice and earth. Despite the evident suppleness, there's a sense of weight and structure that suggests ageability as well. Drink 2015â€“2022..
