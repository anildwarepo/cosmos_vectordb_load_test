country: US.
description: Winemaker Heidi Barrett was making Moscato way before the current craze started, so you can call her a visionary. Her 2011, an unusual blend of fruit from Napa Valley and Paso Robles, is a real crowd pleaser. Tasted in May of 2012, it's a little spritzy, which gives a nice, clean edge to the orange, vanilla and white flower flavors. While it's dry, there's a rich edge of honey. The alcohol is a refeshingly low 12.8% by volume..
