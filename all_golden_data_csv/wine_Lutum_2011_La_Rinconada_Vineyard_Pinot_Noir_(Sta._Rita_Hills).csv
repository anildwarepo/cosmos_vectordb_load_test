country: US.
description: Lutum is a project from Santa Barbara vintner Gavin Chanin. The brand sources fruit from well-known vineyards, in this case Rinconada, situated in a favorable terroir in the southern part of the appellation. The wine is quite pale and the alcohol level is low, giving it great delicacy. But it's potent in raspberry, red currant, spicy red licorice and softened cola flavors. Delicious now, it will age well until at least 2022..
