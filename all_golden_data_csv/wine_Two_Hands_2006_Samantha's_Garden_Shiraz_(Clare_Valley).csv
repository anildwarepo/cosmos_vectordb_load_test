country: Australia.
description: This wine's elevated alcohol level (16.2%) gives it plenty of fullness on the palate, and combined with jammy fruit and superripe tannins makes for a slightly sweet palate impression and a creamy texture. It does offer waves of raspberry and blueberry fruit topped by hints of cinnamon and vanilla as well as savory undercurrents of grilled meat and tapenade. Drink now and over the next few years for its exuberant fruit..
