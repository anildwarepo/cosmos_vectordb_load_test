country: US.
description: This tiny-production wine continues to impress vintage after vintage, a small project of the Nunes family, who otherwise farm Nunes Vineyard. Aged in a selection of new and once and twice-used French oak, it impresses in wound-up kirsch, baked bread and cardamom spice, remaining both high toned and smoothly complex on the palate. Rose petals and citrus flirt into the body of the wine as well as the finish..
