country: US.
description: The winery held this wine back from release for an additional year longer than their other new Cabs—which are from the 2010 vintage—for a good reason: to let the fruit catch up with the tannins. It has begun to, but only barely. Still shows the tight astringency of a young Howell Mountain Cab, but the core of fruit is brilliant in black currants, cassis liqueur and blueberries. Give it until 2017 to emerge, and it will drink beautifully for many years afterward..
