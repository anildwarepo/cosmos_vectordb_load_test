country: France.
description: The nose at first is all about aromatic orange zest but with a little more air there are lovely hints of jasmine and honeysuckle. The palate adds a judicious bitterness and counters this with residual sweetness. The counterpoint here is between texture and full fruit. This is incredibly powerful, as if some inner force was at work. This seems like a genie in a bottle—willful, driven and deliciously aromatic. The finish is off dry and long. Lovely now but sure to last. Drink 2017–2040..
