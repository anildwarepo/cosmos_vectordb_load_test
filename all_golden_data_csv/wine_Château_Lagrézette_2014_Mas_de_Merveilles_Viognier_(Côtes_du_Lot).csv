description: Rocamadour has been one of France's top pilgrimage sites since the Middle Ages but the vines only returned a decade ago. So Lagrézette's director-enologist, Claude Boudamani, went to the rock. The result is a pure Viognier, ripe and impressively rich. Classic apricot flavors come through strongly long with spice from wood aging. The wine pushes forward with its powerful fruitiness and intense flavors. Drink from 2017..
