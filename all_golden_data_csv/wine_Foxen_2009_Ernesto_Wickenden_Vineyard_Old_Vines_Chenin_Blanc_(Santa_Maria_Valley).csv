country: US.
description: For years, Foxen has been producing one of the best Chenin Blancs in California, and with this 2009, they have outdone themselves. It's so rich in orange, honeydew and pineapple flavors, it might almost be Chardonnay, except it's drier and more minerally, and there's a wonderful note of dried herbs. Although production was only 575 cases, this wine is worth a special search, especially for sommeliers..
