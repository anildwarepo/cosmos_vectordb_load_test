country: US.
description: A lovely example of Pinot Noir from one of the rare places in Washington that can do the flighty grape justice. It is a 50/50 blend of the 2008 and 2009 vintage—a crafty winemaker decision that has worked beautifully. The wine strikes a perfect balance, neither too young and sharp, nor too soft and fruity. Light touches of cedar and smoke wrap around fruit flavors of strawberry and cherry pie. It stops a little short at the moment, but that might just be a function of limited bottle age..
