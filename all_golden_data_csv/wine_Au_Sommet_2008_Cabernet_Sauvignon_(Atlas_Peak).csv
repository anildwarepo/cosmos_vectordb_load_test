wine_Au_Sommet_2008_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Atlas_Peak),"Unnamed: 0: 127372.
country: US.
description: So good, so rich, so stunning, it's just a joy to drink even now in its youth. Defines the Heidi Barrett style of big, ripe, exuberant fruit and a classic structure, enhanced in this case by the firm tannins and fine acids of Atlas Peak. Explosive in blackberry and cherry pie filling and cassis flavors, with a distinct mineral tang that must come from the volcanic soils. Contains 2% Petit Verdot. Superbly enjoyable, but as a brand new wine, its future is only a guess. Drink nowâ€“2014?.
