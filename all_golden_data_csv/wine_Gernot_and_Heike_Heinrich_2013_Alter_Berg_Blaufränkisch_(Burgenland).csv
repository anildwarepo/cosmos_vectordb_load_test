country: Austria.
description: Brooding notes of black, crunchy cherry along with wood smoke and fir rise from the glass. On the palate there is a vein of tart, lively freshness that draws earthy smoke and full fruit notes towards the core, leaving shadows of smoke and fir, cherry, blueberry and white pepper around the fringes. Freshness is far more of a defining factor than silky tannins. This is authentic, unforced and very fresh..
