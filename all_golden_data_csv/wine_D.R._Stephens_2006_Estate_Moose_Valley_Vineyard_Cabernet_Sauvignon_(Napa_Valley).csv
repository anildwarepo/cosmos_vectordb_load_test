country: US.
description: Too young for drinking now, or anytime soon for that matter. It's all primary blackberry and currant fruit, new oak and tannins. But there's a dramatic quality to the structure, a purity of parts that suggests the cellar. There are waves of licorice, mocha and buttered cinnamon toast, with everything vying for supremacy. Let all the elements battle it out for a good six years. This wine should age gracefully through 2015, at least..
