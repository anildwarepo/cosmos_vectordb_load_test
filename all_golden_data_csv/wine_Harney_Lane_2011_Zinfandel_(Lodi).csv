country: US.
description: Imagine coffee ice cream drizzled with boysenberry syrup and you get the gist of the flavors of this full-bodied, rather sweet Zinfandel. Aromas of toasted oak barrels and fresh roasted coffee beans leap out of the glass as you sniff, then rich cherry and boysenberry flavors coat your tongue.  The alcohol is noticeable, but it carries so much flavor along with it that it comes off as decently balanced..
