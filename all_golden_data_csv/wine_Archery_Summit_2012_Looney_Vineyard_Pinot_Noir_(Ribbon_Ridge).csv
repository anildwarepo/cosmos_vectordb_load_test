country: US.
description: The Ribbon Ridge AVA is home to a small, select group of near-cult wineries, and fruit such as this is the reason why. Compact and refined, it delivers beautiful aromas of raspberries, with a subtle dustiness that might be Oregon's answer to Napa's famed Rutherford dust. Terrific concentration and pinpoint definition make this a wine to savor immediately, or cellar for enjoyment through 2025 and beyond..
