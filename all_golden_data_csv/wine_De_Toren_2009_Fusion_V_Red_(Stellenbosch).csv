country: South Africa.
description: A layered and complex wine, the 2009 Fusion V is one remarkable selection that's delicious now, although it certainly shows the stuffing to age well for another three to five years, at least. Forward sweet-oak notes marry harmoniously with black-fruit aromas on the nose. The robust, dense palate offers ripe flavors of cassis, blackberry and plum, with accents of leather, tobacco and licorice that linger long into the finish. Chewy, gripping tannins provide a firm structure, framing the full fruit flavors..
