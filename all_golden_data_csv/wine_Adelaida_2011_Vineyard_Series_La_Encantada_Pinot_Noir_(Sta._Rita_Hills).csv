description: Paso Robles-based Adelaida is better known for Rh√¥ne varieties, but they can turn out a pretty good Pinot Noir, if they can get their hands on good grapes. Now, through their Vineyard Series, they've obtained Encantada fruit, with excellent results. The wine is ripe in cherries and raspberries, yet has deeper, earthier notes of mushrooms, cola and herbs, finished with spices. It's a very fine bottle that's ready to drink now, and should develop over the next six years..
