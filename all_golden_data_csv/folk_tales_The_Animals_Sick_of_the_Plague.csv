title: The Animals Sick of the Plague.
text: The sorest ill that Heaven hathSent on this lower world in wrath,—The plague (to call it by its name,)One single day of whichWould Pluto’s ferryman enrich,—Waged war on beasts, both wild and tame.They died not all, but all were sick:No hunting now, by force or trick,To save what might so soon expire.No food excited their desire;Nor wolf nor fox now watch’d to slayThe innocent and tender prey.The turtles fled;So love and therefore joy were dead.The lion council held, and said:“My friends, I do believeThis awful scourge, for which we grieve,Is for our sins a punishmentMost righteously by Heaven sent.Let us our guiltiest beast resign,A sacrifice to wrath divine.Perhaps this offering, truly small,May gain the life and health of all.By history we find it notedThat lives have been just so devoted.Then let us all turn eyes within,And ferret out the hidden sin.Himself let no one spare nor flatter,But make clean conscience in the matter.For me, my appetite has play’d the gluttonToo much and often upon mutton.What harm had e’er my victims done?I answer, truly, None.Perhaps, sometimes, by hunger press’d,I’ve eat the shepherd with the rest.I yield myself, if need there be;And yet I think, in equity,Each should confess his sins with me;For laws of right and justice cry,The guiltiest alone should die.”“Sire,” said the fox, “your majestyIs humbler than a king should be,.
