country: Australia.
description: Although not nearly as flashy as many of its brethren, this is a well balanced Barossa Shiraz that could cellar well. Hints of mint accent the nose, bolstered by toasty oak, while the flavors feature red currants and raspberries. The acids are reasonably crisp given the context, lingering nicely on the finish. Fine to drink now, but try to save a few bottles until 2020 or so to see how it develops..
