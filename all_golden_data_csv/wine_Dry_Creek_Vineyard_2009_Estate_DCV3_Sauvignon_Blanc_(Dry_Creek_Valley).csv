description: If there was any oak on this wine, and the winery doesn't say so, it doesn't show. What stars is pure fruit from the vineyard, the first ever planted to Sauvignon Blanc in Dry Creek Valley. The flavors are massive, of citrus and tropical fruits, melons, tangy minerals and exotic spices. Just gorgeous, it's one of the most complex and satisfying Sauvignon Blancs on the market. Production was a scant 252 cases..
