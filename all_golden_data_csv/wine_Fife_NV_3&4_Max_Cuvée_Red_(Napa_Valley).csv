country: US.
description: This is a combination of 2003 Petite Sirah, as well as Syrah from both 2001 and 2004. Vineyards from Spring Mountain comprise a majority of the blend. The multi-vintage approach works well, for the wine has the softness and bouquet of an older wine, with the fresh, ripe fruit and acidity of a young one. Raspberries, cherries, blueberries, plums and sweet leather and Asian spices are the main flavors..
