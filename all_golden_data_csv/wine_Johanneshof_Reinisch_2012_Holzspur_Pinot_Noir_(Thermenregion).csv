country: Austria.
description: Right now this speaks of earth, forest floor and oak leaf—but not in a mature way. This Pinot takes time to show the glorious red cherry that is there in abundance, caressed by gentle, smoky oak. This will take time to blossom but will reward patience. Balance between acidity and silken body is evident and the layers of leaf, earth, cherry, smoke and minerality will continue in their infinite Pinot alchemy. Drink as of 2016..
