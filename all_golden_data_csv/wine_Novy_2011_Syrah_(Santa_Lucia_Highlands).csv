description: Kudos to winemakers Adam and Dianna Lee for managing to wrest a Syrah this likeable from the difficult 2011 vintage. It's almost worth aging, with a delicious core of molten blackberries, black currants and green tea, and significant tannins, the kind that lock the palate down. And the wine may in fact hold and develop a bit. But the fruit won't outlast the tannins much beyond 2017. Whenever you drink it, give it a few hours in the decanter..
