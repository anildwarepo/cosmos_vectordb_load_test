country: France.
description: This combination of tingling grapefruit spice, pure lemon and leafy lemon balm on the nose is utterly disarming. The touch of green apple makes it even more alluring. The palate jumbles all of these fresh, lithe, bright and appetizing flavors together and swirls them across the palate on a joyous, light-footed lemon sweep. Oh for the pleasure of Riesling in a vintage that majors on freshness rather than ripeness. This dances on the tongue with its dryness, purity and aromatic ease. Underneath all that is concentration and a stony, firm core that anchors this in quality. A lovely, promising and utterly charming wine. Drink 2017–2030..
