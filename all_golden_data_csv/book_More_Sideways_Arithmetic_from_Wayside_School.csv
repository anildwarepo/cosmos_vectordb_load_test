These Sideways Arithmetic problems may look puzzling at first, but you can use real maths to solve them, and the answers are perfectly logical. Three are lots of clues and hints, plus all the answers are right there in the book. Best of all the children you have read about in the other books about Wayside School are here to help you! Try solving the brainteasers in this book, along with Mrs Jewls and the children from her class, and maths will be a dream!.
