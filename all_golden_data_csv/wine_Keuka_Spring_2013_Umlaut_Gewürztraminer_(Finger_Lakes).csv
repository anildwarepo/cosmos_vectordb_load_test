country: US.
description: Slicks of butter, cream and spice in this unusual barrel-fermented Gewürztraminer may evoke divisive love-it-or-hate-it reactions, but the intensity and quality of this deeply concentrated wine is hard to deny. It's gorgeously fruity and floral, bursting of honeysuckle, rose petals and melons, yet elegantly balanced in acidity and alcohol. It's deeply penetrating, with reverberating waves of bright citrus notes and a lingering tea-toned astringency. Drinks well now, but should be an interesting wine to mature over the next decade..
