country: US.
description: As the Stolpman family's top-of-the-line bottling each vintage, this wine impresses on all fronts. Candied boysenberry, dried lilac, snapped dark chocolate and hints of dried mint show on the nose. The entry into the palate is refined and soft with juicy mulberry and elderberry fruit plus touches of thyme and forest floor. Firm but polished tannins and a decent dose of acidity ensure long drinkability. Drink nowâ€“2029..
