wine_La_Follette_2010_Van_der_Kamp_Vineyard_Pinot_Noir_(Sonoma_Mountain),"Unnamed: 0: 58375.
country: US.
description: A tremendous wine, this appeals to the senses as well as the intellect. Dry, tart in acidity and somewhat tannic, it shows complex flavors of raspberry and cherry pie, bacon, cinnamon, white pepper and sandalwood. The finish goes on and on. So delicious now, you can hardly keep from drinking it, but this is a Pinot Noir that will age for 6â€“8 years, gradually losing primary fruit and gaining interesting mushroom and dried fruit notes..
