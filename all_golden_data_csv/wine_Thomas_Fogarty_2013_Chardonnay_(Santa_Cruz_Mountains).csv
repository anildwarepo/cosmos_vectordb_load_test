wine_Thomas_Fogarty_2013_Chardonnay_(Santa_Cruz_Mountains),"Unnamed: 0: 85157.
country: US.
description: From one of the preeminent Chardonnay producers in the country comes their least expensive yet perhaps most stunning bottling, showing strong lemon rind, sea salt, Gravenstein apple and a floral touch of honeysuckle on the nose. The wondrously zippy and saline palate is framed by a grippy, grapefruit-rind-led tension, but opens just enough to allow the slightest hints of lemon curd and delicate marzipan warmth..
