country: France.
description: Maison Bouachon is an old négociant house based in Gigondas. It's now owned by the Skalli family who is trying to raise the level of the wines. This Côtes-du-Rhône cuvée is a promising effort, boasting plenty of black cherry fruit to go with hints of leather and game. The fruit shows a hint of sur-maturité, yet remains fresh, while the mouthfeel is round yet not unstructured. Drink now–2010, possibly longer..
