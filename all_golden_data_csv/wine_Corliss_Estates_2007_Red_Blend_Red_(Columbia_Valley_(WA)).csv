country: US.
description: Smooth and textured, this is a supple, lightly earthy and aromatic Bordeaux-style blend. The principal components are Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with smaller amounts of Malbec and Petit Verdot. One gets the feeling that the winery was still finding its way during production; this was made by a winemaker no longer at Corliss. Berry, plum, fig, dried herb and cedar are all in the mix—it's more genteel than generous..
