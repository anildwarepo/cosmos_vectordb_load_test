wine_Firesteed_2003_Pinot_Noir_(Willamette_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 116338.
country: US.
description: The 2003, though still just 13% alcohol, seems to have more stiffness to the structure, more tannin and more density than the 2002. It's harder, chewier, less open and more challenging. It may also age more slowly. Right now there is a certain stemminess and bitterness to the tannins that keeps the fruit at bay, though the aromas seem to promise more. It may profit from an hour or two of breathing..
