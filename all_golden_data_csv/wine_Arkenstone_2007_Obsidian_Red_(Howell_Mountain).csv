country: US.
description: So softly delicious, so complex and sensually satisfying, this Bordeaux blend, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon and contains all the other classic varieties, is truly a wine to savor. The blackberry and cassis flavors have an edge of chocolate, and the deliciousness is compounded by superbly ripe, sculpted tannins and a long but thoroughly dryfinish. Dazzlingly good, and could develop bottle complexity over the years..
