wine_Terra_Valentine_2004_Yverdon_Vineyard_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Spring_Mountain_District),"Unnamed: 0: 90337.
country: US.
description: A new bottling from the winery, made from vines grown 2,000 feet up the mountain that were planted only in 2001. It's far too immature to drink now or anytime soon. The tannins are thick and on lockdown, the blackberry, cassis and cherry fruit all primary and not yet integrated with the oak. But these parts are high-quality and need time to mesh and develop. Best after 2010 through 2016 and beyond..
