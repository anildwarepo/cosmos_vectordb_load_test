country: US.
description: Regional pioneer Rick Longoria delivers a savory, earthy wine from the vineyard he planted, with meaty aromas of shiitake and porcini mushrooms, black slate, cedar and fresh pomegranate. The palate is more reliant on peppery spice, rose-petal florals and dried herbs than fruit, though dried cherries make an appearance, especially on the lasting finish. It's great now, but will thrive for at least a decade. Drink 2018â€“2028..
