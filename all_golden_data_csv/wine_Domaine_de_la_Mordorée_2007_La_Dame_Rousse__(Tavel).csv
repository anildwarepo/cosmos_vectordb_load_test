country: France.
description: A terrific expression of its appellation, the 2007 La Dame Rousse from Domaine de la Mordorée starts off a bit tight and minerally on the nose, then explodes on the palate with layers of cherries, peaches, warm stones and dried spices. It's full-bodied and rich, with a long, spice-driven finish. Treat it like a light red, serving it with charcuterie or simple grilled meats, and drink it over the next year or so..
