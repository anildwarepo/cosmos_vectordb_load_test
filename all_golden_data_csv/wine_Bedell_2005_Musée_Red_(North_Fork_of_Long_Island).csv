country: US.
description: This elegant red blend—the new flagship wine from Bedell—starts with a soft, juicy nose with hints of cedar and cinnamon. On the palate, a burst of cherry, plum and blackberry flavors mingle with spice and smooth tannins. The finish has an appealing spin of exotic spices. Though ready to drink now, the wine will benefit from a few years in the cellar, allowing its elements to even further integrate..
