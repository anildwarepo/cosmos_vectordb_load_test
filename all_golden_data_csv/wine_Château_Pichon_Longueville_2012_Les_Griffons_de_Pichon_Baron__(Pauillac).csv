description: The equivalent of an alternative second wine from Château Pichon Baron (with Les Tourelles), Les Griffons is named after the statues of griffins that are in the chateau's courtyard. This is a structured wine, firmly tannic while already showing plenty of black currant fruitiness. Equal measures of Merlot and Cabernet balance the wine and give depth of flavor. It will develop soon and will be drinkable from 2017..
