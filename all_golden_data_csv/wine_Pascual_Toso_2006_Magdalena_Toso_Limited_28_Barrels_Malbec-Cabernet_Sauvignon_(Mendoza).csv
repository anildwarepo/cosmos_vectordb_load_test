country: Argentina.
description: Bargain hunters need not apply, but if you're looking for a pricey but serious Argentine red, the '06 Magdalena Toso is a fine place to begin. At 70% Malbec and 30% Cab, it's stout, dark and rich. Aromas of coconut and mint announce new French oak, while the density and purity of the blackberry and plum fruit is commendable. Finishes long and ripe, with spice, prune and leather. Good acidity ensures that it will age well for three to five years..
