country: US.
description: Cabernet Sauvignon makes up 35% of this blend, along with 26% Syrah, 26% Merlot, and 13% Cabernet Franc. Aged in 70% new French and American oak, barrel-forward aromas of vanilla, coconut and baking spice are out in front of a medley of dark fruit. The fruit flavors are sweet, rich and luscious, with toothsome tannins providing support. There's plenty of enjoyment to be had but the barrel influence is pretty intense..
