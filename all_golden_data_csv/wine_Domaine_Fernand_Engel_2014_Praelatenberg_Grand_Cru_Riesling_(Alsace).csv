country: France.
description: Earth, apple, citrus and herb all mingle on nose. Green apple tinged with chamomile edge strikes against bright lemon on the dry palate. This is full of refreshing citrus and a beautifully understated vigor which will live in this wine for years to come. The finish culminates in a gorgeously tart but ripe apple notion. Very moreish now and approachable but with lots of future promise. Drink 2017–2030..
