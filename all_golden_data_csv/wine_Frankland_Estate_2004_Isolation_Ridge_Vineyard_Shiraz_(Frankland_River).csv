country: Australia.
description: This is the sort of Shiraz that forces tasters to re-examine their view of the variety as produced in Australia. It starts off with powerful aromas of cracked pepper and floral notes evocative of violets, then delivers explosively spicy flavors of pepper and licorice cushioned by ripe blackberries and a rich, supple texture. It's the best of New and Old Worlds. Drink 2010â€“2020 plus. Imported by USA Wine West..
