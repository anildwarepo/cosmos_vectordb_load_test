wine_Saviah_2013_Hunt_&_Gather_Red_(Walla_Walla_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 92914.
country: US.
description: This wine is half Funk Estate Vineyard Syrah, with the rest McClellan Estate Cabernet Sauvignon. The two varieties somewhat seem to cancel each other out initially, with aromas of smoked meat, cherry, herb and earth that don't seem fully resolved. The palate brings a smooth, elegant styling to the red and blue-fruit flavors. There's plenty of interest, but it doesn't all entirely come together at present..
