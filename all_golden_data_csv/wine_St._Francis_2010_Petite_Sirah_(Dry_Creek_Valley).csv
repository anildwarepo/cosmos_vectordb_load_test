country: US.
description: This is great Petite Sirah, and classically Dry Creek Valley in style. It has the weight and texture of a fine Cabernet, with gorgeously smooth tannins, but it's the flavors that really make you reach for another glass. Offers blackberries, black currants, bacon, charred meat bone, pepper and anise flavors that go on and on into a long finish. Will age for a long time, but you can drink it at any point in its journey..
