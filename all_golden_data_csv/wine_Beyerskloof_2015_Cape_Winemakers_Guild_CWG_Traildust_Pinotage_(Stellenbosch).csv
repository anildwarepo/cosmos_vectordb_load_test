country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Beyers Truter. A selection from Mr. Pinotage, this is somewhat closed and shy at present, but shows a core of tight black fruit, oodles of spice, a full structure and ample acidity to suggest this is designed for some time to age. Touches of char, tree bark and leather add earthy, gamy accents to the blackberry and boysenberry fruit tones. The plush texture, with firm but well-integrated tannins, is pleasantly balanced and easy to like. It's drinkable now, but should really chill for a few years; try after 2020..
