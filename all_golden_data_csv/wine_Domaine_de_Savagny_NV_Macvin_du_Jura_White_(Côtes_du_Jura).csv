country: France.
description: Putting alcohol with grape juice has a long tradition right across France. It doesn't make it any less bizarre. The problem is the alcohol doesn't blend with the grape juice, with two elements sitting alongside each other. This wine, with its sweet fruit flavor of marmalade that is cut by a strong brandy spirit sharpness, is for those who like strange drinks. Enjoy as a long drink and as an aperitif..
