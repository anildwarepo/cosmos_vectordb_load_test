country: US.
description: Elegance is the keyword for all the wines of DDO, with the added bonus of structure that almost begs for cellaring. This lovely Pinot Noir effortlessly captures the essence of the grape without any heavy-handed oak, alcohol or over-ripeness. Truly Burgundian, a moderate 14% alcohol, it offers seamless integration of berry and plum fruit, natural acids and lightly applied oak accents of sandalwood and toasted cracker..
