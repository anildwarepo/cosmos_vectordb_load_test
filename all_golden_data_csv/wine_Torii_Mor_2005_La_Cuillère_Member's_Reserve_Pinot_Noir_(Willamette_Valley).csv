wine_Torii_Mor_2005_La_Cuillère_Member's_Reserve_Pinot_Noir_(Willamette_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 59896.
country: US.
description: A blend of seven different vineyards, the name is French for spoon. This is a softer, less tannic wine than most of the other Torii Mor 2005s, but is not quite what you would call silky. Mixed red fruits, light scents suggesting flower as well as berry, and a feminine elegance characterize this Pinot. It's been carefully crafted to emphasize the subtle herbs and spices, without hiding behind the more obvious flavors of new oak..
