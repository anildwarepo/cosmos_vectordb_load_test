country: US.
description: A “best-barrel blend” that's a 50-50 Pommard and Dijon clone mix. The black-cherry fruit is framed with a bit more barrel toast than the other Brick House Pinots, having been aged for 18 months in 40% new wood. As with all BH wines, it's impeccably clean, minimally handled and elegantly balanced. Biodynamic farming brings added textural details, lengthens the finish and surprises with its complexity..
