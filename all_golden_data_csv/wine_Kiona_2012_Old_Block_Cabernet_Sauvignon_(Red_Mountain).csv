country: US.
description: This flagship effort showcases the winery's oldest block of Cabernet, planted in 1975—the first vineyard on Red Mountain. The subtle, slightly grainy and grassy nuances of old-vine grapes are here, with red-fruit flavors that are soft and delicate, yet substantial. There's a light dusting of cinnamon, a whiff of smoke and an over-riding elegance. Such old vine, 100% Red Mountain Cabernet from a great vintage doesn't come along very often..
