country: Spain.
description: Like an ugly duckling that's a beautiful swan in waiting, this unique rosé, if you can call it that given its rusty, almost brown color, is something only Terroir Al Limít would bottle. Earthy in aromas, this mix of several Grenache strains tastes of apricot and dried red fruits. It's mildly spicy throughout, with actual tannins from skin contact. Drink this quasi rosé as you would a serious white or red, meaning with good food like a Catalan-style rice dish. And drink now..
