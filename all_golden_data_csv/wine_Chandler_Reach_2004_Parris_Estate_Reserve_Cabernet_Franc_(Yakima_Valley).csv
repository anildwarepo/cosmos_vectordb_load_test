wine_Chandler_Reach_2004_Parris_Estate_Reserve_Cabernet_Franc_(Yakima_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 118715.
country: US.
description: This is 100% Cab Franc, and Chandler Reach has a particular talent with this grape. This is almost jet black, saturated with color, and it goes deep with sweet, ripe black cherry and black olive flavors. The dark stuff is balanced by fresh acid, well-modulated tannins and a finish with pleasing texture and balance. It's muscular, herbal and smooth, with hints of coffee in the finish. Tastes even better after being open for 24 hours..
