country: US.
description: At 98 years of age, the vineyard certainly qualifies as old vine, which isn't the case with all wines so labeled. Who really knows what varieties actually constitute these ancient vineyards, but this wine is certainly rich in Zinfandel character. The wild raspberry and cherry fruits have a briary edge, suggesting the tartness of Dr. Pepper cola, the nettles of summer chamomile and the savoriness of green peppercorn. There's little question that the wine will age well, but there's no reason not to drink it now, with proper decanting..
