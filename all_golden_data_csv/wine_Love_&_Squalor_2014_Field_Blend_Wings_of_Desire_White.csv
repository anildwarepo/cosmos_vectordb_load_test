country: US.
description: Sourced from an experimental vineyard planted in the early 1970s, this blends eight different varieties, all picked on the same day and co-fermented. At least one red grape (Cabernet Sauvignon), adds a touch of amber to the wine. It could be called rosé, though it's listed as a white wine. In any event, it's unique, with concentrated flavors of tree fruits, citrus peel and anise. Try it with charcuterie..
