country: France.
description: Faint notes of ripe pear are only hinted at on the nose but on the dry palate they open up into pure, textured, precisely drawn fruit. There is concentration and a heady, seductive lemon and pear perfume hovering over the concentrated, profound palate of wet stone and immensely pure lemon oil. This comes on light, delicate feet but leaves you with a deep, lasting and impressive memory of Riesling purity and elegance..
