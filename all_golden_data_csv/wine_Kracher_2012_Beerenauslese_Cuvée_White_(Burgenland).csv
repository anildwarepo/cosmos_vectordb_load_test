country: Austria.
description: Musky hints of apricots mingle with honeyed botrytis notes. The palate reveals a luscious, mellifluous sweetness that is carried by a fine seam of pure, citric acidity. This Beerenauslese treads lighter than a TBA, making it suitable for the less rich, less sweet occasions. This is to be celebrated for its core of citric purity which makes all the apricot richness sing, echoing long after the last drop..
