First Page Reviews: Brilliant. Amazing. Perfect. I am enjoying using this app so much. The art projector is fascinating, the art filters and interesting and the art selfie is really funny! This app has created an Earth-sized window into an art world mostly inaccessible to me otherwise. Thank you Google. A platform for free exploration and learning. When I first installed this app, I wouldn't be able to say much about it, given the limited amount of features that it provided.

When I first installed this app, I wouldn't be able to say much about it, given the limited amount of features that it provided. But coming back to it now in 2020 (while many museums are closed), I've been trying out the AR virtual tour features and am very excited for the current and future possibilities this provides not only to consumers, but also to the suppliers/hosts of the physical content (i.e. the museums). Thanks Google, and keep it up! ðŸ–– When I'm using front camera, it turns upside down and doesn't detect every faces it captures. Please fix this for the next update. ðŸ˜Ÿ Crashes every time I try to use it. I'm very disappointed, was planning on using this a lot. I'm hopeful they'll fix it, but maybe they only want iphone people..
