country: France.
description: The nose is still closed and gives away little. The palate has a voluptuous shape but comes tightly corseted: all is present but still closely held. The peachy fruit has a serene easy sweetness that has its perfect counter measure in orange and Meyer lemon freshness. This is poised and sweet but countered and cut by immense freshness. The aromas have yet to unfold fully. Both blood orange and peach lurk promisingly. It is the seamless poised texture of this late harvest that stands out, along with supreme purity. Wait for this. Drink 2020—2035..
