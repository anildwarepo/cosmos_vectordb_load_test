description: Winemaker Gustavo Gonzalez left Robert Mondavi to do his own thing, and what an auspicious start. He's taken fruit from this historic Carneros vineyard and crafted a big and bold yet balanced Pinot filled with lusciousness. The flavors are enormously complex, ranging from fresh raspberry jam and cranberries to red currants and persimmons. Earthy cola, mushroom and forest floor notes add complexity. The acid-tannin balance is just about perfect. Good as it is, this compelling Pinot should develop well over the next six years..
