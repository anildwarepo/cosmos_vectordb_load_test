wine_Wachtstetter_2013_Steillage_Trollinger_(Württemberg),"Unnamed: 0: 120427.
country: Germany.
description: Trollinger, also known as Schiava or Vernatsch outside of Germany, is a rarity in the U.S. market, but this delightfully crisp, raspberrry-scented bottling is worth seeking out. It releases sweet raspberry and cherry perfume, but also darker notes of smoke, granite and cedar. Cranberry and strawberry flavors are tingling and tart, framed by tight tannins and a deep granite finish. Drinks well now but should improve further from 2021..
