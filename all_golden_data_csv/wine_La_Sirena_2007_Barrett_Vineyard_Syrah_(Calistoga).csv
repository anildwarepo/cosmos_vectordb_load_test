country: US.
description: This Syrah tries to strike a balance between rich opulence and controlled elegance, and it largely succeeds. It's has exquisite tannins and fine acidity, finishing bone dry. The flavors are complex, immediately suggesting ripe blackberries, with notes of beef tartare, grilled wild mushrooms splashed with tamari, black pepper and minerals. You can draw analogies to the northern Rh√¥ne if you want. Will it age? Hard to say, but it's a great wine now..
