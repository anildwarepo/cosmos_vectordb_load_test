country: South Africa.
description: An absolutely stunning selection, this opens with herbal tones of verbena, lime leaf and fynbos that sit atop a core of honeydew rind, apple and white peach. The medium-weight palate is sleek and smooth, but not flat, enlivened by bright acidity and a stony minerality. The just-ripe flavors of pear, citrus and melon carry through to the long finish. It's delicious now, but should age well through 2022..
