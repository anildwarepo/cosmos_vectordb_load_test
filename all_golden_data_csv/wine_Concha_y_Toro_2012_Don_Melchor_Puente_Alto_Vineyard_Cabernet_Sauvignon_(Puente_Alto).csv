country: Chile.
description: This is a riper, heavier than usual Don Melchor, as evidenced by aromas of raisin along with black plum, coffee and creamy oak. A full, round, plush palate offers more than adequate depth, while black cherry, plum and vanilla flavors come with hints of licorice and chocolate. Hailing from a hot vintage, this avoids almost all herbal characteristics but feels a bit soft and simple. Drink through 2023..
