short_description: <p>Between 1696 and 1760, six ensembles of reducciones (settlements of Christianized Indians) inspired by the &lsquo;ideal cities&rsquo; of the 16th-century philosophers were founded by the Jesuits in a style that married Catholic architecture with local traditions. The six that remain &ndash; San Francisco Javier, Concepci&oacute;n, Santa Ana, San Miguel, San Rafael and San Jos&eacute; &ndash; make up a living heritage on the former territory of the Chiquitos.</p>.
