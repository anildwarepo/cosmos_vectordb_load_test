country: France.
description: A lifted ethereal note of dried hay flowers hits you first. This is followed by generously ripe but very purely drawn fruit: Conference pear, star fruit and white currant. There is concentration on the palate, coupled with a pervasive citric freshness that almost lends this an exotic aspect. You simply want to savor and take another sip. An edge of pleasant bitterness corrals the fruit admirably. The finish is dry, lasting and intriguing..
