title: The Rat Retired from the World.
text: The sage Levantines have a taleAbout a rat that weary grewOf all the cares which life assail,And to a Holland cheese withdrew.His solitude was there profound,Extending through his world so round.Our hermit lived on that within;And soon his industry had beenWith claws and teeth so good,That in his novel hermitage,He had in store, for wants of age,Both house and livelihood.One day this personage devout,Whose kindness none might doubt,Was ask’d, by certain delegatesThat came from Rat-United-States,For some small aid, for theyTo foreign parts were on their way,For succour in the great cat-war.Ratopolis beleaguer’d sore,Their whole republic drain’d and poor,No morsel in their scrips they bore.Slight boon they craved, of succour sureIn days at utmost three or four.“My friends,” the hermit said,“To worldly things I’m dead.How can a poor recluseTo such a mission be of use?What can he do but prayThat God will aid it on its way?And so, my friends, it is my prayerThat God will have you in his care.”His well-fed saintship said no more,But in their faces shut the door.What think you, reader, is the serviceFor which I use this stingy rat?To paint a monk? No, but a dervishA monk, I think, however fat,Must be more bountiful than that..
