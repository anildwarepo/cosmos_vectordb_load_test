country: US.
description: One of a growing number of micro-boutiques in Oregon, Vidon made its first wine in 2003. Subsequent vintages were quickly sold out, with quantities as low as two barrels of individual wines. This 2007 is in better supply, and well worth seeking out. Fragrant with sweet strawberries, hints of fresh herb, a Dr. Pepper soda streak particular to Oregon and nicely laid-in oak, it's a seductive and focused effort that masks its high alcohol effectively..
