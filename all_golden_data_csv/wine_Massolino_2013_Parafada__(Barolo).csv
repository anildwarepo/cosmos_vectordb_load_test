wine_Massolino_2013_Parafada__(Barolo),"Unnamed: 0: 119645.
country: Italy.
description: Aromas of new leather, ripe dark berry, vineyard dust and a whiff of smoky flint waft out of the glass along with floral and balsamic notes. The full-bodied palate shows great energy and intensity, delivering juicy Marasca cherry, ripe cranberry, white pepper and clove framed in youthfully assertive, refined tannins and bright acidity. A mineral note wraps up the lingering finish. With time, this will develop even greater complexity. Drink 2023–2053..
