country: US.
description: Expensive, yes, but this is a very great Cabernet, and the Sacrashe Vineyard repeatedly proves itself as one of the best in Rutherford, if not Napa Valley itself. The 100% Cabernet, which is a limited production barrel selection of only 420 cases, is so delicious in blackberry jam, chocolate, olive and cedar flavors, it's hard to not drain the bottle now. But it also shows fabulously rich tannins that suggest aging. May not be one for the long haul, but certainly great over the next six years..
