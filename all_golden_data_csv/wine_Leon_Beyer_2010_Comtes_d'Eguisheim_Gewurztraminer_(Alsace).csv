country: France.
description: Restrained notes of honeyed richness rise from the glass. The ripe peach scent has floral overtones. The palate has a fluid, almost oily feel but is dry. A wonderfully fine phenolic edge helps to provide structure to this evolving Gewurztraminer, as do aromatic notes of orange zest. The harmonious balance of body and weight, of concentration and elegance on this dry wine are exemplary. The finish is long and elegant..
