country: US.
description: This is the winery's third vintage, and they continue to make elegant, supple and snappy wines. This is the ripest to date, and has a healthy 14.7% alcohol level, but it retains many of the spice and herbal highlights that keep it interesting. The fruit brings on berries, plums and some of the brambly character of Zinfandel; the barrels add clove and nutskins. Cola and sassafras wrap into the sharp finish..
