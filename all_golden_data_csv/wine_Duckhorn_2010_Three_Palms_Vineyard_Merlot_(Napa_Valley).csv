country: US.
description: Hard tannins give taut astringency to this wine. But then, that's the signature of Three Palms, which always starts life tight and tough. Made since 1978 by Duckhorn, the wine has shown a consistency rare among Merlot single-vineyard bottlings. This 2010 shows Three Palm's hard tannins, but has such lush black cherry and mocha fruit that it's easy to drink now. It's a worthy followup to the magnificent 2009, but better structured. Drink nowâ€“2020..
