country: Portugal.
description: A powerful, concentrated wine, it has great density and structure. It shows the quality of the vintage, rich and fruity while preserving the elegance and poise that is typical of Chryseia. The result of a partnership between the Symington family and Bruno Prats from Bordeaux, it has a smooth, ripe, black fruit character underpinned by firm tannins. It needs several years to age, so drink from 2017..
