country: US.
description: How's this for exotic: this red blend is made from the vinifera grapes Saperavi (from the former Soviet Georgia) and Sereksiya Charni (generally from Moldova). On the nose, the wine displays clove, tart berry, raspberry and black pepper, and on the palate, like flavors and solid tannins. There's a touch of dried tea to the blend and a decent finish, but the wine needs time to age--consider holding it for 5-10 years for the complexity to unfold. Overall, an appealing and interesting choice..
