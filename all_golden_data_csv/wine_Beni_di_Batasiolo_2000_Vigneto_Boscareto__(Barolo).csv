country: Italy.
description: Many 2000 Barolos are showing signs of retreating into their shells, none more so than this. This was initially very dumb, and only after a good deal of swirling and plenty of time in the glass did it begin to show anything. At last, dark fruit,  earth, rose petal and road tar began to emerge. On the palate it was tannic and again took its time to open, but again it showed some complexity, with a medium finish. A wine that needs a decade in the cellar..
