country: New Zealand.
description: Like several other producers of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, Jackson Estate is trying to make a cuv√©e that offers something more than stereotypical tropical fruit and fresh herbs. This is a partially barrel-fermented effort that boasts brown sugar and cinnamon aromas, and flavors that mix coffee with lime and passion fruit. It's not entirely harmonious, but offers concentration and innovation, something that should be applauded..
