wine_Sante_Arcangeli_2015_Duet_Chardonnay_(Santa_Cruz_Mountains),"Unnamed: 0: 102244.
country: US.
description: The small 2015 vintage didn't give John Benedetti much to work with, but he sources 60% from Bald Mountain Vineyard in Bonny Doon and 40% from Split Rail in Corralitos to deliver this stunner. Aromas of Marcona almond, buttered croissant and lemon preserves lead into a palate full of acidic energy. Salty, savory flavors of roasted nuts meet with warm buttercream and fresh lemon spray on the palate. It provides a full experience..
