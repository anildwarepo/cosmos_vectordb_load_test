country: US.
description: This is the first release from this particular vineyard for the Syrah-focused winery. Its aromas, which pop with notes of strawberry and spice, have both herbal and copper-penny undertones. The fruit and savory flavors play well off of each other, showing a sense of elegance and deftness, with a touch of new wood that contributes to the flavor and feel. The finish stretches out. It still drinks quite young and if the aromas meld together could move up a notch or two..
