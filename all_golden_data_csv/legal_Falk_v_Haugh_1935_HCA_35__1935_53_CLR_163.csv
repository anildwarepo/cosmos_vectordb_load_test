The respondent Commissioner lodge with the Court and with the taxpayer applicants draft declarations and/or orders giving effect to the reasons for judgment within fourteen days, including orders as to costs. 72 The taxpayer applicants asserted further that none of the authorities relied on by the Commissioner addressed what the taxpayer applicants described as the divergence of views between Hoysted and Broken Hill in relation to tax matters, save briefly in Falk v Haugh [1935] HCA 35 ; (1935) 53 CLR 163. That litigation was concerned with relief against forfeiture, in the context of emergency legislation enacted in the depression years to address hardship arising from the consequences of default in payment of mortgage indebtedness, in circumstances where such payments as had been made by a mortgagor to a mortgagee had been received and applied by the mortgagee on account of the mortgage debt generally and thus without distinction as to principal or interest, thereby resulting in default as to payment of interest, and further where the mortgagee had entered possession and received rents and profits pursuant to a default which appeared to have differing statutory consequences, depending on whether the same relating to principal or interest. In the joint reasons for judgment of Rich, Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ in Falk at 171, the following appeared: '...The reasons of the Full Court for refusing to determine the questions reserved may be taken to be the basis of the decision by the County Court that interest had not been paid. The decision in the County Court was that interest had not at that time been paid up to a given date. The question at issue here is whether it has now been paid up to another and later date. An affirmative answer to that question involves no necessary contradiction of the County Court decision. The issues are not the same; but the decision of each issue involves a common question, namely, what, in the case of a mortgagee in possession, amounts to payment. It is this question with which the reasons of the Full Court deal. It may, therefore, be right to regard those reasons as forming only a subsidiary ground leading to the decision of the issue between the parties, and not as constituting the decision of an issue. An estoppel of this kind arises from the decision inter partes of an ultimate issue identical with one of the ultimate issues that are again raised. But it does not arise from the adoption of a process of reasoning in the decision of the issue, although the same process may be applicable in the decision of a second and different issue. It is upon this ground, if at all, that the decision of the Privy Council in [Broken Hill] is to be reconciled with its decision in [Hoysted].' The Commissioner had contended that the foregoing dicta in Falk was to the effect that 'the advices of the Privy council in Broken Hill and in Hoysted were capable of being reconciled upon the basis that an estoppel does not arise merely by reliance upon the process of reasoning in an earlier decision', and further, that 'the High Court did not decide that Hoysted was wrong, and that Broken Hill was to be applied in Australia instead of Hoysted', and that therefore so much is the law in Australia, notwithstanding that the Privy Council itself did not treat the two decisions as consistent with each other and disavowed the authority of Hoysted '. The Commissioner's analysis in relation to Falk , so far as it goes, must be correct, and is not sufficiently answered by the circumstances that the Privy Council decided in Caffoor at 599-601 to follow Broken Hill instead of Hoysted by reason of the latter's inconsistency with the line of English authority there identified in Caffoor. Moreover there is much to be said for the view that the critical findings of the primary judge and of the Full Court in Spassked referrable to the period of time from 1988 to 1994 (both of course inclusive) which I have earlier cited, cannot aptly be described (to adopt parts of the Falk dicta ) as ' only a subsidiary ground leading to the decision of the issue between the parties.' Moreover it would be at least more realistic to say that on true analysis, such findings comprised or formed part of ' the decision... of an ultimate issue identical with one of the ultimate issues that are... raised' , to cite from the above passage in Falk . 74 More recently in Orica Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2001) 182 ALR 77, Merkel J, as a Federal Court judge at first instance, said as follows (at 87), in the context of a capital gains tax dispute, upon which the taxpayer applicants sought to place additional reliance in support of the same major theme of their present case: 'Issue estoppel has been held not to apply to a taxpayer where the previous decision relied upon as founding the issue estoppel related to a different year of income. Although there was some support for the contrary view in [Hoysted] , that decision was not followed in [Caffoor] . In Caffoor the Privy Council determined that a taxpayer is not estopped from contending it was entitled to an exemption in respect of a year of income by a decision in respect of a different year of income. More recently, in [Chamberlain] Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ cited Caffoor as authority for the proposition that ""the Commissioner is not bound by a determination made in respect of an assessment for one year, so far as other years are concerned"". It must follow that the Commissioner's issue estoppel argument also fails.' The estoppel issue raised in Orica was in the nature of an alternative contention, and arose in the context of the 'relation back' provisions of s 160U of the capital gains tax provisions of the Tax Act and did not occupy the principal focus of attention of those proceedings. It appears that Merkel J was not provided with the substantial scope of juridical references to and analysis of authority that has been presently afforded to the Court by the parties in contest, including that analysis and debate referrable to the High Court's later decision in Queensland Trustees Limited v Commissioner of Stamp Duties [1956] HCA 75 ; (1956) 96 CLR 131, which I will shortly next discuss, or for that matter to Falk . The decision in Orica did not survive appeal (see Commissioner of Taxation v Dulux Holdings Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1344 ; (2001) 113 FCR 436), though the issues of the scope here arising did not feature in the reasons for judgment on that appeal. I will later return to Orica . 106 Moreover it is further appropriate to point out that the context and circumstances of the present proceedings are I think significantly distant and removed from those of the authorities relied upon by the taxpayer applicants, being principally of course Broken Hill, Caffoor and Hope , such as to render those authorities of no sufficient assistance here to the taxpayer applicants as judicial precedents. I have drawn attention to those contexts and circumstances in the course of my review of those cases. Moreover as I have earlier discussed in the context of the reasons in the joint judgment I have extracted from the High Court's decision in Falk, there is at least something plausible to be said for the view that Broken Hill and Hoysted are susceptible to reconciliation and thus distinction in operation, and in any event, that Hoysted should be preferred to the extent of any inconsistency. So much would be in line with the observations of the three members of the High Court in Queensland Trustees who reviewed the United Kingdom authorities. Moreover I do not think that the taxpayer applicants gain assistance of sufficient significance here from the relatively brief citation of Caffoor appearing in the joint judgment of three members of the High Court in Chamberlain , for the reasons I have earlier mentioned, which included reference to the proposition that ' the Commissioner is not bound by a determination...' , and thus not contextually to a process of reasoning leading to a substantive determination by a superior court of record. In none of those English authorities moreover was the doctrine of abuse of process, additionally to estoppel, apparently invoked. 112 The taxpayer applicants contended of course for the operation of a per se entitlement to litigate, discretely or cumulatively, in relation to each of the 1991, 1993 and 1994, and apparently also the 1996, fiscal year revenue objections, and the consequential disputes the subject of disallowed objections, in line with those English decisions of high authority. Bearing in mind those distinguishing jurisdictional features, and as the Commissioner moreover rightly observed, if the taxpayer applicants were to be permitted to raise for redetermination each and all of the same substantive issues, or virtually so, that were raised, considered and determined in the earlier Spassked proceedings, albeit that the latter proceedings were geared and related to a different fiscal year (ie 1992), being issues principally as to the purpose of relevant borrowings, and as to the use or otherwise of borrowed funds in activities carried on for the purpose, or otherwise in the course of gaining or producing assessable income, and if the taxpayer applicants were to be successful in any such further proceedings against the Commissioner, there would be on record, as I have already mentioned, what would be inconsistent or substantially inconsistent reasons for judgment of the Federal Court. All that would constitute situations well removed, conceptually as well as contextually, from that involved for instance in Saffron . Moreover there was reversed by the Privy Council's decision in Broken Hill what had been an earlier decision of a Full Bench (by majority) of the High Court of Australia, and there was inconsistency between that decision of the Privy Council and the almost contemporaneous Privy Council decision in Hoysted , involving an appeal which also emanated from Australia . Moreover as has been further mentioned, Hoysted was applied by the Full Court in Chamberlain (though the principal judgment of the High Court in Chamberlain cited Caffoor though briefly and not in any controversial context), and Caffoor and Hope did not involve appeals from Australia. Furthermore Dixon J (as he then was) in Blair v Curran cited Hoysted , not irrelevantly in terms of the scope of principle here the subject of scrutiny. The High Court in Falk , without expressing any preference, pointed to the dilemma in reconciling Broken Hill with Hoysted. More directly of assistance to the Commissioner's case moreover was the favourable approach taken to Hoysted adopted by those three members of the High Court in Queensland Trustees who made reference to Hoysted. In all those circumstances, the emphatic approach adopted by the taxpayer applicants in the present proceedings as to the operation authoritatively of the Privy Council decisions in Broken Hill , Caffoor and Hope might be thought to have at best debateable viability, particularly if account be also taken of the nature and extent of the jurisdiction and functions exercised by the tribunals etc from where at least the litigation in Caffoor and Hope originated..
