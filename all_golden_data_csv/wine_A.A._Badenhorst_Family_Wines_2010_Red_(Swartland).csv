country: South Africa.
description: Despite its age, this has the depth, concentration and structure to continue to age well through 2022. A blend of 74% Shiraz, 18% Grenache, 6% Cinsault and 2% Tinta Barocca, there's a pure character to the wineâ€”herbal notes of minty fynbos, bark and freshly tilled soil are supported by vibrant plum, raspberry and cherry. There's a minerally graphite seam to the full-bodied palate, ending on lush notes of black pepper, bittersweet cocoa and espresso..
