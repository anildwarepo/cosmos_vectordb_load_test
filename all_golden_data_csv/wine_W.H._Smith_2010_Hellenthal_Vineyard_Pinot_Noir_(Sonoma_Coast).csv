country: US.
description: From a vineyard in the Fort Ross-Seaview appellation, this is clearly one of the best wines of the vintage. The mouthfeel is light and silky, with refined tannins that give it a slight astringency. The flavors are vast and complex with raspberries, cherries and cola, but also forest notes of mushrooms, balsam and herbs. The acidity is fresh and appealing. It's gorgeous now, and should evolve over the next 15 years..
