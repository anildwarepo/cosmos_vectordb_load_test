country: US.
description: This is a completely unique wine for the state, one that calls out more to the Loire Valley than to Rattlesnake Hills. Coming in at a cool 12.5% alcohol—in a vintage known for average temperatures—it brings detailed notes of flowers, cigar box, raspberry and moist earth. With nine months of neutral French-oak aging, there's barely a trace of oak influence. It's lighter in style but still brings good depth with a long, flavorful finish. As far from a cocktail wine as you can get; serve this one at the dinner table..
