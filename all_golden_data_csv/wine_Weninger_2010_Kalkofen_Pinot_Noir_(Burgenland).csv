wine_Weninger_2010_Kalkofen_Pinot_Noir_(Burgenland),"Unnamed: 0: 94791.
country: Austria.
description: Spicy oak flavors dominate the nose and marry beautifully with the red berry, cherry and forest floor notes. This is Pinot made in an international style that nonetheless keeps its Austrian backbone of fresh acidity and lovely, tingling pepper spice. The fact that this is from 2010 and has just began to show its colors signals its seriousness. It is ready now but will also reward further cellaring. Such depth and length at 12.5% are a real achievement—in its own wonderful way, Pinot is never about power..
