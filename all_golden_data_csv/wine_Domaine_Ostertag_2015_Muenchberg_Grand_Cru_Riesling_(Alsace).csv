country: France.
description: There is something incredibly fruity and simultaneously tart on the nose: It is reminiscent of honeyed deaf nettle blossom as well as passion fruit. Wet stone and lemon heighten these perceptions even more. The palate comes in with concentrated zestiness—there almost is a sobering edge of bitter pith that pulls us towards the earth while the soaring lemon and grapefruit notes lift towards the light. This is fruitful promise and airy spirit, earthy depth and boundless richness. All this comes as a bundled force of joy, freshness and utter pleasure. That beguiling, lemony wet stone appears again on the dry intense finish of this elixir-like wine which perhaps has not only captured the light of the sun but that of the stars, too. Drink 2022–2040..
