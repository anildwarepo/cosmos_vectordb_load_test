country: US.
description: Dark, thick and aromatic, this blend of 63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Franc and 5% Syrah can stand alongside others selling for two or three times the price. It's a supple mix of dark fruits and spicy herb; it almost bristles with sharp hints of nettle, pepper and green tea. The tannins are supple and smooth, and there is a polish to the wine that extends into a smooth, seamless and very satisfying finish..
