description: This wine will divide aficionados. Some will find it too soft and fruity. Others will marvel at its sheer deliciousness. It's fantastically rich, a wine of deliriously decadent flavors, ranging from blackberry jam and cr√®me de cassis to mocha, blueberry extract and buttered cinnamon toast. Yes, it's soft, but it's the softness of fine velvet. After all that richness, the finish is amazingly dry. Drink over the next few years to enjoy its youthful beauty..
