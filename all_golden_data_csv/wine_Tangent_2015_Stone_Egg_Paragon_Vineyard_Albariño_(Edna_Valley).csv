country: US.
description: Many vintners are now using stone and concrete vessels to craft part of their blends, but this Niven family project goes all the way by bottling their stone-aged wine solo. Light in the glass, the wine shows aromas of honeysuckle, Meyer lemon pith, Bosc pear skins and crushed limestone. The palate's grippy texture carries bright, acid-powered flavors of Granny Smith apple, nectarine and Mexican lime..
