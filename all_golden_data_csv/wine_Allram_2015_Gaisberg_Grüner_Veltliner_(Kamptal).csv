country: Austria.
description: The very gentle but seductive notion of sun-ripened red-cheeked mirabelle plums radiates like sunshine from the glass. With a further sniff there also is peppery greenery: yarrow and hay. The palate also unites this friendly fruit with the savory spice of these herbs and comes in a light-footed, compact and fresh package that just dances on the tongue. This is deceptively frivolous Grüner with a seriously delicious concentrated core..
