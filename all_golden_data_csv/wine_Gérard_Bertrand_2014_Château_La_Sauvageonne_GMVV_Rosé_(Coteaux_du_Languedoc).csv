country: France.
description: This interesting and complex rosé—made from 65% Grenache, 25% Mourvèdre, 7% Vermentino and 3% Viognier—is aged for six months in oak. The resulting wine is a cellar-worthy selection that boasts upfront notes of toasted spice, lemon custard, vanilla bean and ripe red berries. The oak influence currently dominates the plush and generous palate, while the creamy texture and lingering smoky spice are enticingly decadent. While you can enjoy this rich wine now, give it some time for the oak to mellow and further integrate with the fruit; drink now–2017..
