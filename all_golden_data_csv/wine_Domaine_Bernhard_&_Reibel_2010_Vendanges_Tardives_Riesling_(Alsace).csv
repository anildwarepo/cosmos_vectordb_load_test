country: France.
description: The golden color suggests evolution and the nose does not disappoint, presenting lifted notes of petrol, saffron, candied lemon and mandarin. Rich sweetness on the palate pairs with 2010's laser-sharp acidity, becoming more honeyed with each moment. This acidity still rings with greengage and lime freshness, providing lift. In the middle of its evolution, the wine is developed but still has potential. Drink now–2026..
