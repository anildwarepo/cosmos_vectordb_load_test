short_description: <p>Built by the Moors in a defensive position at the heart of the Caliphate of Cordoba, Cuenca is an unusually well-preserved medieval fortified city. Conquered by the Castilians in the 12th century, it became a royal town and bishopric endowed with important buildings, such as Spain's first Gothic cathedral, and the famous <em>casas colgadas</em> (hanging houses), suspended from sheer cliffs overlooking the Hu√©car river. Taking full advantage of its location, the city towers above the magnificent countryside.</p>.
