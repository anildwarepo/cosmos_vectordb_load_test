country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Pierre Wahl. This wine is 100% barrel fermented and aged 14 months in new and second-fill French oak, but it holds it's wood well. It's rich and toasty at first, with scents of toasted brioche, apple skin, peach pit and pressed yellow flowers that carry through to the plush palate. Flavors of orange and melon rind, as well as superb acidity, help to cut through the wines richness alongside a subtle tannic texture. A wine that begs for food, this should age well through 2022..
