wine_Silvan_Ridge_2002_Early_Muscat_-_Semi_Sparkling_Muscat_(Oregon),"Unnamed: 0: 62854.
country: US.
description: This Beaver State answer to Moscato d'Asti is sweet, sweet and more sweet. Who knows what the actual residual sugar reading is? That said, the lemon-lime aromas with notes of basil and tarragon are nice, and the wine is currently quite fresh (although it likely won't last long). Not too bubbly or aggressive, and pretty in the mouth due to fairly snappy acids. Drink now with fruit-based desserts or frosted cake..
