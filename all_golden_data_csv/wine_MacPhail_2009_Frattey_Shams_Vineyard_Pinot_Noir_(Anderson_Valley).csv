country: US.
description: Extraordinarily rich, this Pinot Noir dazzles with extracted cherries and raspberries, with exotic mulberry additions that have a spicy, feral, meaty quality. Top Anderson Valley vineyards often show this wild note, so welcome in an era when ripe fruit is easy to achieve. On a par with MacPhail's great 2007 Frattey Shams bottling, and the good news for consumers is that they've lowered the price considerably. Drink nowâ€“2016..
