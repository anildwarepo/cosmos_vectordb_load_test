short_description: <p>The property is located in central and southern parts of the Republic of Korea, and comprises nine <em>seowon</em>, representing a type of Neo-Confucian academy of the Joseon dynasty (15th -19th centuries CE). Learning, veneration of scholars and interaction with the environment were the essential functions of the <em>seowons</em>, expressed in their design. Situated near mountains and water sources, they favoured the appreciation of nature and cultivation of mind and body. The pavilion-style buildings were intended to facilitate connections to the landscape. The <em>seowons</em> illustrate a historical process in which Neo-Confucianism from China was adapted to Korean conditions.</p>.
