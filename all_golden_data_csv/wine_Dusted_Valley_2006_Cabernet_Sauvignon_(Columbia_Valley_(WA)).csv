wine_Dusted_Valley_2006_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 115482.
country: US.
description: This is a Bordeaux blend; the winery's entry-level Cabernet. What that means, say the winemakers, is that it's made to be a little softer, more fruit forward—a wine for immediate pleasure. Most is estate (Walla Walla) fruit, despite the Columbia Valley designation. It's soft and fruity, with strawberry and juicy fruit/tropical flavors. Not exactly plump, but broad and generous, with a little spicy kick to the finish..
