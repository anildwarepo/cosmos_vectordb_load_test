country: Austria.
description: All the secrets of this wine are still locked away—only time will reveal them. There are glimpses of lemon and grapefruit and notions of yeast on a thrillingly pure, streamlined and linear palate. Right now there is fruit, with time there will be eternal stone. This is Riesling with true pedigree. There is a lesson, too: You can impress with Federspiel, it does not always have to be Smaragd! Drink now until 2030..
