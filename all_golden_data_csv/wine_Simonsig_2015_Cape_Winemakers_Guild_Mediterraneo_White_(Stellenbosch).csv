country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Johan Malan. A blend of 66% Roussanne, 28% Grenache Blanc and 6% Verdelho, this opens with pretty scents of tangy orange zest, crisp pear and melon rind, all framed by hints of fresh hay, savory herbs and a chalky minerality. The medium-weight palate is round and soft, yet enlivened by bright acidity that carries through to the finish, alongside notes of clove-spiked orange and toasted oak. Drink nowâ€“2020..
