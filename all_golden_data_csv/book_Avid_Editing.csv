Description: This text is for beginning to intermediate users of Avid Xpress, Xpress DV, or Media Composer. These digital editing systems offer a tremendous number of tools that open up myriad creative possibilities for the film and videomaker, but are as a result difficult to master. The chapters guide readers through an editing project, while the accompanying DVD provides narrative footage to download for immediate, hands-on practice. The book can be read and studied at home, or while sitting in front of an Avid, following the book's step-by-step instructions. The new edition is updated to reflect the latest versions of Avid software, including an emphasis on the Xpress DV for Mac and Windows. There is also new material on Script Integration, a powerful tool now available on almost all of Avid's products, and a new chapter on how Avid can help the reader create material for current and future widescreen television formats. A beginning text designed for anyone new to the Avid Complete step-by-step instructions assume no prior knowledge Companion DVD contains footage from a narrative scene, so students can begin editing immediately.
