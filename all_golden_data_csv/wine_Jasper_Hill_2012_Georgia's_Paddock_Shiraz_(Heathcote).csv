country: Australia.
description: When the alcohol levels are reined in to appropriate levels, this can be one of Australia's top Shiraz. The 2012 is a stunning example of balance and finesse, combining youthful scents of cassis and toasty oak with floral elements. There's ample weight and texture yet silky elegance at the same time, while already complex notes of orange pekoe and black currant are sure to gain even more with five or 10 years of cellaring. Drink 2020â€“2030..
