Description: ""The new reading text of Billy Budd, Sailor in this volume is based on a corrected version (also printed here) of the ""Genetic Text"" that was prepared by Harrison Hayford and originally published in 1962 by the University of Chicago Press in a volume edited by Hayford and Merton M. Sealts, Jr. This new reading text employs different editorial principles from those followed in the 1962 volume. Portions of the introduction and notes to that volume have also been used here in an extensively revised form."".
