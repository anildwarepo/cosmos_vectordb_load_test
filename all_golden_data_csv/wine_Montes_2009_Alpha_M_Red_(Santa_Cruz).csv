country: Chile.
description: This is concentrated and stout on the nose, with roasted black-fruit aromas bolstered by coconut, tobacco and cool-earth accents. The palate is thick, rich and layered with black fruit extract and tannin, bearing flavors of dark plum, baked blackberry, savory spice and BBQ sauce. It's smooth, deep and long on the finish, with notes of coffee, vanilla and mocha. A monster wine with class. Drink now through 2018..
