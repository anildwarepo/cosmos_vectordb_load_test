country: France.
description: The richest and most generous hints of dried pear and fruit loaf rise from the glass. The palate continues in the same, generous vein with plenty of pear, shimmering and scintillating with juicy, mellow and just off-dry ripeness. This is countered by fresh lemon zestiness and leaves a totally balanced and very lasting impression. There are pleasant highlights of bitterness and that pervasive sense of pear fruit just lasts and lasts..
