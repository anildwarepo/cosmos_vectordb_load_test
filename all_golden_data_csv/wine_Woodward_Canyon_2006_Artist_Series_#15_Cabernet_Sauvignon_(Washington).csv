wine_Woodward_Canyon_2006_Artist_Series_#15_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Washington),"Unnamed: 0: 56336.
country: US.
description: Predominantly Sagemoor vineyard, along with some Champoux and estate grapes, including some old vine fruit and 13% Syrah. Somehow, the Artist Series Cabernet has an open softness that seems more like Merlot; it's lush and approachable, sleek and liquorous, dotted with malted milk/chocolate highlights around deep black cherry fruit. The aromas are lovely, though at first taste it sags a bit in the late going; the fruit falls off and the chocolaty notes take over. The tannins have a little green tea flavor..
