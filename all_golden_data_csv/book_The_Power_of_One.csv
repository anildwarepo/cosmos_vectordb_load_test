Description: In this 30-day companion workbook to There's No Such Thing as ""Business"" Ethics, bestselling author John C. Maxwell demonstrates how we can live with integrity by using the Golden Rule as our standard-in business and in life. In fact, Maxwell suggests the higher standard of exceeding the Golden Rule-by treating people better than they treat us, helping those who cannot help us, doing right when it is natural to do wrong, and keeping promises, even when it hurts. An ethics guide for any situation, each ""day"" of The Power of One offers a Drilling Down section which features a case study or story that illustrates the day's topic, Summarizing Principles on the subject, penetrating questions for Making Evaluation, and points of application for Taking Action. Maxwell reveals the factors that can ""tarnish"" the Golden Rule and teaches how to develop the Midas touch in personal integrity..
