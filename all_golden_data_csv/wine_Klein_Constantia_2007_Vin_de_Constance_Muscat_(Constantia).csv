country: South Africa.
description: A well-balanced, powerful dessert wine, this opens with an intense bouquet of fresh peach, orange blossom, jasmine, gardenia and honeysuckle. The mouthfilling, sweet palate is loaded with flavors of ripe stone fruit, mango, melon and orange marmelade, but is kept bright by refreshing acidity on the close. Secondary notes of ginger and white tea linger long on the evolving finish. A wine of class and strength, this is delicious now, but should also easily age through 2020..
