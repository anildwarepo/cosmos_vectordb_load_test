country: Austria.
description: This wines arrives on tiptoe, citrus-scented and fresh, but once it expands on your palate it soon fills the mouth with all manner of stone fruits. As befits this vintage, everything is tempered with grapefruit zestiness but both mirabelle and apricot richness not only lend flavor but also a beautiful texture that insinuates quince and blood orange zest. What a triumph, what a marvel. Irresistible now but with incredible concentration this is built to last. Drink now till 2020 at least..
