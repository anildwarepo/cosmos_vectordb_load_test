country: Austria.
description: Woodsmoke, flint and a textured midpalate reminiscent of crushed velvet, shot through with zesty lemon, make this a delicious, stylish Chardonnay, known in these parts as Morillon. This vintage right still fresh as a daisy and shows the aging potential of this grape that thrives beautifully in numerous places. Right here it benefits from the combination of brilliant sunshine and cool, continental nights. Ripeness and tension in unison..
