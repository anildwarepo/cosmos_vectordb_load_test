country: US.
description: Given neutral oak, native yeast, passive carbonation and left unfined and unfiltered, this sublime wine, made by Pax Mahle and sourced from a windswept vineyard impacted by the Petaluma Gap, doesn't hold back in flavor or complexity. Gamy manure and white pepper mingle on the nose before opening the way to sultry, brooding waves of spicy, tangy orange and plum. This wine is pretty and powerful at the same time, while riding a low-wave of alcohol..
