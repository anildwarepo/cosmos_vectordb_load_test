wine_Penfolds_2009_St._Henri_Shiraz_(South_Australia),"Unnamed: 0: 85279.
country: Australia.
description: Because St. Henri is aged exclusively in large, mostly neutral oak vessels, it often requires more time to come around than Shiraz aged in barrel. The 2009 is tight and reticent on the nose, while showing hints of boysenberry, black olive and roasted meat on the palate. Full bodied, rich and firm in structure, with a long, amply textured finish, it needs a few years in the cellar, and should last at least through 2030..
