country: Austria.
description: A hint of yeasty earth still clings to the lifted, uncompromising citrus purity that rises from the glass, still as tightly closed as a leaf-bud in winter, yet holding everything in readiness to burst forth after some bottle age. The wiry, dry, straight-laced citrus thrill is already perceptible. What else will flourish is a mystery although that it will be of exquisite quality and purity is a without a doubt. Lay this treasure down and look forward to it. Drink 2018–2015..
