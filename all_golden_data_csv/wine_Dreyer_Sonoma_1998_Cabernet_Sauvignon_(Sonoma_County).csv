country: US.
description: There’s some really fine Cabernet character in this affordable wine, which contains 10% Merlot. It’s got black-currant and plum fruit, finely etched and pure, with a light touch of oak, and there’s some real substance and depth of flavor. You’ll be surprised at the classiness at this price. It’s a mystery how this winery achieves wines this good when they could be selling them for much more. Best Buy..
