country: France.
description: The nose is not inclined to give much away at this early stage. The palate, however, freely gives wonderfully tart apple fruit that has a juicy ripeness and the tang of lemon. The palate is dry and streamlined, with a wonderfully racy focus of freshness and concentration. Yet this remains svelte and toned. It is the lemony tang that creates such a deliciously lip-smacking and refreshing finish. Lovely now but sure to develop. Drink 2017–2027..
