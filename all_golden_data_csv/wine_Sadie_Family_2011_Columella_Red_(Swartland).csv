country: South Africa.
description: One of the finest selections from South Africa today, Sadie's 2011 Columella is structured, complex and masterfully balanced, ready for a beautiful, long life ahead. The bouquet leads with lovely scents of rooibos tea, minty fynbos and African violets that frame the ripe boysenberry, blackberry and plum fruit spine. Layers of lush black fruit and earthy spice dance on the velvety palate, with peppery tannins that hang on to the lingering finish alongside hints of cocoa powder, licorice root and star anise. Drink now–2024..
