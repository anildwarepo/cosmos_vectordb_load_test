country: US.
description: McKinley Springs vineyard has provided the grapes, and Joe Gunselman has crafted a spicy, forward and aromatic Syrah, co-fermenting it with 5% Viognier. The light fruit flavors of raspberry and pie cherry—remain clear and fresh through the mid-palate, but fail to add to that slender strength in the finish. In fact, the wine turns a bit chalky, and feels prematurely dried out, without the complexity that made the glorious 2005 so memorable..
