description: This interesting blend consists of 31% Cabernet Franc, 30% Syrah, 20% Merlot and 19% Cabernet Sauvignon. Roasty, toasty aromas explode from the glass, with gorgeous barrel notes of cedar and smoke. Bright raspberry and cherry fruit is set amid generous streaks of caramel, maple syrup and coffee liqueur. High-toned and expressive, it is the most accessible and complete of the 2009 releases from Fielding Hills..
