country: US.
description: Though younger than most current Petite Sirah releases, this bottling impresses wildly with fragrant boysenberries and crushed lavender on the nose, proving to be a floral-driven style that's not beaten down by richness or ripeness, despite the higher alcohol level that doesn't show at all. Insane amounts of cracked white and black pepper meet with toasted sesame seeds, tart boysenberries and more lavender on the palate..
