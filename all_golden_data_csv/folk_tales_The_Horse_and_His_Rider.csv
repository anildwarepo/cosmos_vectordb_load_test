title: The Horse and His Rider.
text: A Young Man, who fancied himself something of a horseman, mounted a Horse which had not been properly broken in, and was exceedingly difficult to control. No sooner did the Horse feel his weight in the saddle than he bolted, and nothing would stop him. A friend of the Rider’s met him in the road in his headlong career, and called out, “Where are you off to in such a hurry?” To which he, pointing to the Horse, replied, “I’ve no idea: ask him.”.
