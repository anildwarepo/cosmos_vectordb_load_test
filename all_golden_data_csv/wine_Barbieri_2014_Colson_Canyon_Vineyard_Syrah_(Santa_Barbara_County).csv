country: US.
description: Extremely dark in the glass, lavish aromas of black currant, black pepper, lilac, violet and blooming chaparral show on this bottling from a remote vineyard north of the Santa Maria Valley. It's a smooth sip at first, with ripe elderberry and black fruit, but the tannins stiffen quickly to reveal a masculine wine, with peppery spice, rounded vanilla and a strong acidic slice cutting through the density..
