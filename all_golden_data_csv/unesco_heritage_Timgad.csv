short_description: <p>Timgad lies on the northern slopes of the Aur√®s mountains and was created <em>ex nihilo</em> as a military colony by the Emperor Trajan in AD 100. With its square enclosure and orthogonal design based on the <em>cardo</em> and <em>decumanus</em>, the two perpendicular routes running through the city, it is an excellent example of Roman town planning.</p>.
