country: Italy.
description: What a delightful wine this is. Loaded with finesse, it opens with lovely scents of red berry, crushed rose, graphite, cooking spice and Alpine herb. The beguiling medium-bodied palate offers sour cherry, raspberry, white pepper and mineral while fresh acidity and polished tannins provide impeccable balance. It's already drinking beautifully but will also provide several more years of pure enjoyment..
