country: US.
description: The Horseshoe Bend Vineyard, which is in the cool Laguna part of the southern valley, is capable of great Pinot Noir. In a warmer vintage, the wines are lush. In chilly ones like 2011, they're elusive. But the wines always have great structure. This bottling is marked by acidity, tannins, dryness and a superbly silky mouthfeel. The flavors veer between barely ripe cherries and pomegranates to green tomatoes and celery leaf. The wine needs time. Give it until 2017 to begin to show its stuff..
