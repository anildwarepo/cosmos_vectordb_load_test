country: France.
description: Here's an interesting rosé fans of obscure winegrapes will love. It's 90% Tibouren, an old variety indigenous to Provence that's known for its finesse but also for its difficulty in the vineyard. This wine also stays an entire year in tank resting on its lees, so it's not a fruit-forward rosé at all. Hints of apricot and peach are subtle, with the emphasis being on the wines crisp acids and dry finish..
