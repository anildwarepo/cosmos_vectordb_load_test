country: US.
description: This beautiful Cabernet has all the hallmarks of a wine that will go the distance. Tasted in late summer, 2013, at nearly four years of age, it's bright and fresh in black and red currants, mocha, licorice, baking spices and smoky sandalwood. But it's also quite tannic. The balance is superb, though, strongly suggesting further development through at least 2021. Expensive, yes, but it's right up there with Napa's best..
