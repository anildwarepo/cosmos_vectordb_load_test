country: US.
description: Structure may be the Holy Grail in Oregon, even trumping terroir. This wine has an abundance of both; the Dundee Hills fruit brings rich flavors of blackberry and black cherry, along with interesting notes of iron and earth. But the lovely structure—a perfect balance of fruit, acid, oak and alcohol—takes the wine into a more complex dimension. It moves gracefully through the palate, adding a note of spice or a new fruit as it goes, then lingering in a taunting, teasing finish..
