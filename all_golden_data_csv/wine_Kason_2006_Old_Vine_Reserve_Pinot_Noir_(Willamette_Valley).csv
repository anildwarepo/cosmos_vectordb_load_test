wine_Kason_2006_Old_Vine_Reserve_Pinot_Noir_(Willamette_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 52944.
country: US.
description: Given 22 months in new French oak, this reserve Pinot Noir still brings the fruit front and center. Blackberries rule here, but there is a strong menthol/mint streak as well, which leaves the palate feeling as if a curiously strong breath mint has recently passed through. Kason seems to have great fruit sources, packaged in a rather rustic style, but offering quite delicious and bold flavors at moder prices..
