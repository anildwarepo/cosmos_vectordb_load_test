country: France.
description: Apart from the fact that this wine comes from a small parcel that is itself called Saint-Joseph, the other curiosity of this wine is its label, which is designed like a banknote, by the man who used to design French francs (now, of course, out of a job). The wine inside the bottle is powerful and concentrated, flavored heavily with new wood, vanilla and spicy fruits. Guigal believes it is possible to make great Saint-Joseph, and this wine certainly proves the point..
