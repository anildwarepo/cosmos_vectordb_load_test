description: A sensational varietal Petit Verdot that's rich and velvety, lush and intense, with a hint of Bordeaux's typical herbiness, that evolves into some of the best blackberry, mocha and spicy chocolate you can imagine. Winemaker John Kinney had originally planned to blend the two barrels that eventually became this wine. Be glad he didn't. The grapes were sourced from Ghielmetti Vineyard, the primo vineyard to look for in Livermore wines..
