country: Argentina.
description: This oaky, creamy Malbec is one of Karim Mussi Saffie's trilogy of 2011 La Consulta single-vineyard varietals, and they are so similar in aromas, body weight, flavors and high oak levels that they are virtually interchangeable. Like its bretheren, this pours on the wood, vanilla, graphite, pencil eraser and resin along with sweet blackberry and cassis flavors. Maybe with time in the bottle it'll gain more individuality..
