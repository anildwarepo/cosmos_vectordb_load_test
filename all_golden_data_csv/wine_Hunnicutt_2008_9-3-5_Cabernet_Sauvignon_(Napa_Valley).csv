country: US.
description: Another fine 9-3-5 Cabernet from Hunnicutt. The numbers symbolize the proprietors' wedding date. It's a splendid wine, if a little too young. Toasty oak and tannins dominate, but way underneath is a vast, sweet network of blackberries and black currants. You can certainly decant it for a few hours and enjoy now, but this is a wine that should age seriously for a good 8, 10, 12 years. It's a blend of St. Helena, Rutherford and Oakville fruit..
