description: You want soft, cult-style, wildly delicious Napa Cabernet? Here it is. The personal vision of Jeremy Nickel, of the Far Niente and Nickel & Nickel dynasty, this is rich and delicious in blackberry compote, black currant, chocolate, anise and sweet oak flavors. Blended with a few drops of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec, this bottling now establishes itself at the forefront of Napa's most important Cabernets..
