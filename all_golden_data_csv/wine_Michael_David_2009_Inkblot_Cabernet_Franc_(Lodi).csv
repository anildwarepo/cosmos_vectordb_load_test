country: US.
description: Inkblot is Lodi winery Michael David's first Cabernet Franc, a relatively small production wine with MD's signature smoky, toasty coconut aromas, thick and raspberry jammy. Aged 15 months in French oak, it would be a hit with big wine lovers but doesn't exhibit Cab Franc's herbaceousness, which some people will be happy about, others will not. Includes small amounts of Cab Sauvignon and Petite Sirah..
