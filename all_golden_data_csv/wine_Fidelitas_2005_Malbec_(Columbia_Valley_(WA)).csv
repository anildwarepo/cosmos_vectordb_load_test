wine_Fidelitas_2005_Malbec_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 50495.
country: US.
description: Just the second Malbec from Fidélitas, this pure varietal bottling opens with deep, dark aromas of smoke, coffee and pepper, with saturated colors that seem to promise a dense, exotic wine. Though it is lively and offers nice flavors of pepper, berry and spice, it does not have the concentration in the mouth that the aromas suggest. There are some prickly herbal flavors, along with light chocolate, in the finish..
