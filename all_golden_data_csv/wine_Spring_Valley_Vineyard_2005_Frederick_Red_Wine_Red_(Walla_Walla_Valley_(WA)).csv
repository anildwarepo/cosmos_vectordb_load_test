country: US.
description: The Frederick—a Bordeaux blend of 54% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot, 5% Cab Franc and a splash of Petit Verdot—is entirely estate-grown, as are all of the Spring Valley wines. Located north of Walla Walla, in rolling wheat country, the vines attain a different set of flavors than anywhere else in the valley. It's an unusual combination of power (15.5% alcohol) and breed. Supple, sleek, mixing its black fruits with streaks of gun metal, iron and pencil lead, this is a wine that wants to tackle a prime rib, mano à mano..
