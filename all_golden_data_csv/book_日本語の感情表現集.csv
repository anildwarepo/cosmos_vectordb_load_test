Description: This is a student's guide to the expression of emotion in the Japanese language. Arranged by emotion type to cover a wide range of feelings - from infatuation to revulsion - this text offers standard Japanese script, romanized Japanese and English translation. A desire to communicate heart-to-heart with people from another culture is what attracts many people to language study in the first place. But it can take a long time to make friends and feel socially comfortable in a Japanese-speaking context, and there are few textbooks that can help. This volume does just.
