title: The Vultures and the Pigeons.
text: Mars once made havoc in the air:Some cause aroused a quarrel thereAmong the birds;—not those that sing,The courtiers of the merry Spring,But naughty hawk and vulture folks,Of hooked beak and talons keen.The carcass of a dog, ’tis said,Had to this civil carnage led.Blood rain’d upon the swarded green,And valiant deeds were done, I ween.Suffice to say, that chiefs were slain,And heroes strow’d the sanguine plain.‘Twas sport to see the battle rage,And valiant hawk with hawk engage;‘Twas pitiful to see them fall,—Torn, bleeding, weltering, gasping, all.Force, courage, cunning, all were plied;Intrepid troops on either sideNo effort spared to populateThe dusky realms of hungry Fate.This woful strife awoke compassionWithin another feather’d nation,Of iris neck and tender heart.They tried their hand at mediation—To reconcile the foes, or part.The pigeon people duly choseAmbassadors, who work’d so wellAs soon the murderous rage to quell,And stanch the source of countless woes.A truce took place, and peace ensued.Alas! the people dearly paidWho such pacification made!Those cursed hawks at once pursuedThe harmless pigeons, slew and ate,Till towns and fields were desolate.The safety of the rest requiresThe bad should flesh each other’s spears:Whoever peace with them desiresHad better set them by the ears..
