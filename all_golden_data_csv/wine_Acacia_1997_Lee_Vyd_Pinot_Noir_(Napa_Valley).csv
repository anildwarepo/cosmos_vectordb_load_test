country: US.
description: From the Napa side of Carneros, this beautiful wine begins with very forward aromas of cola, black raspberry, black cherry, tomato, mushroom, earth, vanilla, spice and smoky oak. Very fruity and lush in the mouth, with soft tannins. Itâ€™s rich and opulent, offering wave after wave of different sensations that are endlessly fascinating. The finish is fruity and long. Fabulous wine; enjoy it now, or age it..
