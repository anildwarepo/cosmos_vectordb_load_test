country: Australia.
description: Having earned its reputation as one of Australia's finest Chardonnays, the challenge is then to maintain that level of quality. The 2010 Art Series certainly does that. Enticing aromas of woodsmoke, peach and pink grapefruit give way to intense flavors of citrus and stone fruit on the palate. It's full bodied, yet with great focus and length, ending crisply despite the wine's inherent richness. Drink nowâ€“2020, perhaps longer..
