short_description: <p>The Cultural Landscape of the Serra de Tramuntana located on a sheer-sided mountain range parallel to the north-western coast of the island of Mallorca.

The landscape is marked by agricultural terraces and inter-connected water works - including water mills - as well as dry stone constructions and farms.</p>.
