country: France.
description: If you're going to enjoy this wine now, let it open up for a couple of hours to allow some of the nuanced notes to express themselves. Sultry aromas of boysenberry and blueberry are framed with complex additions of purple florals, sweet cured meat, vanilla bean and toasty oak. The palate is lush and mouthfilling, with fine but aggressive tannins and a beautiful minerality to the dark fruit core. Cocoa-dusted truffle flavors flood the long finish; hold until 2016–2020..
