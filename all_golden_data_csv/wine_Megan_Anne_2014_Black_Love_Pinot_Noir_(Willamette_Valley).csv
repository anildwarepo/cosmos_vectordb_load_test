country: US.
description: This best-barrel blend spent 16 months in 40% new oak, and is comprised of fruit from the Nysa and Lachini vineyards, which are also featured as vineyard designate bottlings for this new project from Mark McNeilly (of Mark Ryan Winery). The oak is showing strongly at the moment, with baking spices galore, suggesting gingerbread cookies and dried cherries. The tannins could use a bit more bottle age to soften up, but it's built to last. Drink 2020–2030..
