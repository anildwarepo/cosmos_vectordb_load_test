country: US.
description: Sourced from the original 1965 planting, this wine demands your patience and full attention. Displaying a deep straw, slightly tawny hue, it opens with lightly spicy, nuanced threads of mint, hay, olive oil, green banana and almond. It seems almost ephemeral, but with some hours of breathing time it opens into a full-bodied, dense and compelling wine, with the extra dimensions that old vines can provide. Drink now through 2030..
