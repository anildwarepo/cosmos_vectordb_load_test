First Page Reviews: This is a terrible app. It is designed to discourage people from using it. When you walk into the museum you want to show your membership.

When you walk into the museum you want to show your membership. The first screen that appears is a useless welcome screen with no menu. Then there’s a useless top view of the museum, followed by an equally useless front view. Finally you get a second welcome screen, but you’re still one or two steps from the membership card. The “info” menu takes you to a page offering to sell you tickets, which for a membe I renewed my membership to the Art Institute and wanted this app for the member card feature. It keeps showing my membership as expired, even though I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. I paid for the renewal a week ago. There's no excuse to screw up such a basic feature - poor quality app. I listened to the Andy Warhol narrative but it constantly froze. I had to exit the application and come back again. It was a little frustrating. Timeout repeatedly when attempting to login..
