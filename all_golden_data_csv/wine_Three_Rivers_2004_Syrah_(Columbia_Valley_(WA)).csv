country: US.
description: This is pure Syrah from a winemaker who makes a number of single-vineyard and blended Syrahs. This dark, sappy, seductive wine has you from the first sniff. Though the fruit is big and briary, winemaker Holly Turner manages to capture the polish and elegance of Washington Syrah in the way the flavors are sculpted together. Veins of tar, chocolate, smoke, black licorice, pepper and tobacco accent the young, tight fruit flavors. This wine definitely needs breathing time to show its stuff..
