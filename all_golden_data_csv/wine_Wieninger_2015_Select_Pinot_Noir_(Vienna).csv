country: Austria.
description: A shy nose hints at crushed autumn leaves, fresh red fruit and soft vanilla. The palate has that same interplay of earthiness and red-berry fruit, supported by a gentle nudge of oaky vanilla. Slender and layered, the body shows a firm grip of very fine tannin. Freshness is evident on the finish. While lovely now, this elegant, poised wine will blossom over the coming years: the fruit is pure and ample; the structure firm and lasting. Drink 2020–2030..
