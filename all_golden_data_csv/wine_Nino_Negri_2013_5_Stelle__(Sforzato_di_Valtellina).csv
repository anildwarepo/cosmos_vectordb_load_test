wine_Nino_Negri_2013_5_Stelle__(Sforzato_di_Valtellina),"Unnamed: 0: 8865.
country: Italy.
description: Full-bodied and velvety, this opens with alluring aromas of baking spice, mature plum, violet, Alpine herb and a balsamic note. The concentrated palate is smooth and robust, but it also boasts a weightless quality, delivering dried black cherry, nutmeg, cinnamon, anise, dried date and pipe tobacco alongside firm polished tannins and fresh acidity. A mineral note closes the finish. This is the best Sfursat 5 Stelle I've tried so far. Drink 2018–2028..
