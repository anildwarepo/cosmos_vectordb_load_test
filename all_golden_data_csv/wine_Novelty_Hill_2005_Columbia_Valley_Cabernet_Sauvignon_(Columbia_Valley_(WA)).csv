wine_Novelty_Hill_2005_Columbia_Valley_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 51174.
country: US.
description: This Bordeaux blend brings expressive, dark, tannic, coffee/toasty flavors to the party. The juice is dark and tangy, tight and compact, but fully ripe and balanced nicely against the tannins and natural acidity. The flavors are layered and seamless, rather than floating along the top of the wine and relying on sugar and oak to fill in where the fruit is lacking. This should be your everyday go-to bottle for Cabernet..
