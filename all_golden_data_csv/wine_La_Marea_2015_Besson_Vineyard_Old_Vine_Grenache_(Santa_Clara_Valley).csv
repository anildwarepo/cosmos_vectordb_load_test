country: US.
description: There's a distinctive old-school quality that comes from these century-old vines, which make a slightly lighter wine with intriguing, almost pre-aged aromas of dried cherry, balsamic raspberry and salt-and-pepper spice. The palate is driven by a crushed rock texture and a bright acidity that drives deep into the finish, with flavors of aged cola and dried red fruit. It's even greater with a slight chill..
