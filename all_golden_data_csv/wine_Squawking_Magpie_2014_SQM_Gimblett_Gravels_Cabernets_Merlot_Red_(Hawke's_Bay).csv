country: New Zealand.
description: This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (62.5%), Merlot (25%) and Cabernet Franc (12.5%) is aged in one-third new French oak for 10 months, resulting in a lovely marriage of vanilla and cedar with cassis. The wine is youthful and primary, but the oak and fruit are seamlessly integrated, blending baking spices and chocolate into the mix. Richly textured, with a long finish, this wine is delicious now, but should age well through 2030..
