First Page Reviews: UPDATE: Fixed. Updated score. After I input my access code, it does nothing .
to sign me in. I can continually add the access code, but I cannot sign in. Easier to use than even the school website brilliant work. Nice app overall Needs some design improvements though Thank you for the update! The update is awesome.  I use a Samsung Galaxy S4 and the previous version nearly drove me insane. I loved the idea but it ran slowly and sometimes it didn't even open. I almost deleted it, but this new update is so nice. It looks good and runs smoothly. Thank you for finally fixing it!.
