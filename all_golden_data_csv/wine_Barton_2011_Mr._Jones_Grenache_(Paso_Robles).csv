country: US.
description: Joe Barton, who's made Grey Wolf wines since 1994, launched this brand inspired by pop songs in 2011. This Counting Crows ode delivers aromas of raspberry-laced black tea, clove and cardamom. It's soft and inviting on the palate, with anise, mocha and blackberry flavors that finish with a wash of tobacco. It was still quite tight after hours of being opened, perhaps due to the 35% whole cluster maceration. Drink 2017â€“2023..
