country: US.
description: A blend of Cab and Syrah grown on one of the winery's mountain vineyards, this first-rate wine demands time in the cellar. Bone dry, it shows dramatic layers of blackberries, currants, plums, dark chocolate, herbs and spices, wrapped in a firmly tannic, complex structure. Has that inimitable feeling of importance, but it would be a shame to pop the cork before late in 2008. Should come into its own 2009â€“2012..
