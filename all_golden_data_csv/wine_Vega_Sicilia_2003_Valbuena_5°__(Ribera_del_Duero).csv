country: Spain.
description: Valbuena is Vega Sicilia's so-called second wine, and this vintage is elegant and lithe. To equate it to Burgundian Pinot Noir is not a stretch, seeing that the nose is earthy and dry, with fresh flowers, leather and tobacco aromas. The palate is light and full of finesse, with airy cranberry, earth and cherry flavors. From a poor vintage, this is more than admirable. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines..
