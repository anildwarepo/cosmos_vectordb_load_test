country: US.
description: It is rare to find a high-end domestic Pinot Noir so restrained, so elegant. Lightly layered with tangy raspberry, mineral and herb, this wine proves that supple, graceful, complex, delicious Pinots can be made in Oregon. So often they are sacrificed on the altar of overripeness and oak. Here are authentic flavors of grape and soil, biodynamically farmed and lovingly crafted into a complete and fascinating wine that with attention, gives the drinker more..
