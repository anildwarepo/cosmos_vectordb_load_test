country: Austria.
description: Bergamot and lemon, grapefruit and tangerine: students of citriculture would find much to explore—perfumers too. As a drinker you just want to dive into this inviting, fragrant pool of refreshment. There is a powdery edge too, and quite some texture, despite the most slender of bodies. This represents depth rather than power and is a ticket straight to a citrussy Riesling heaven. With age this will get even better..
