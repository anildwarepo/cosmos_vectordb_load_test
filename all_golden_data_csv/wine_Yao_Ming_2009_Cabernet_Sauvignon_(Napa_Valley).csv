wine_Yao_Ming_2009_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Napa_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 83862.
country: US.
description: A lovely Cabernet, richly attractive and deeply flavored in blackberries, blueberries and black currants. Made from vineyards scattered across Napa Valley, the wine has been blended with a splash of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. It shows a dramatic structure marked particularly by firm, smooth tannins, and it finishes dry. Shows the stuffing to age for 10-plus years, but it's polished enough to drink now, after decanting..
