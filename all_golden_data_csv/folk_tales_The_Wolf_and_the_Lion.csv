title: The Wolf and the Lion.
text: A wolf stole a lamb from the flock, and was carrying it off to devour it at his leisure when he met a Lion, who took his prey away from him and walked off with it. He dared not resist, but when the Lion had gone some distance he said, “It is most unjust of you to take what’s mine away from me like that.” The Lion laughed and called out in reply, “It was justly yours, no doubt! The gift of a friend, perhaps, eh?”.
