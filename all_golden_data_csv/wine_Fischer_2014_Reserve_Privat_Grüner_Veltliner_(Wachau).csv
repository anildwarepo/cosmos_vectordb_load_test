country: Austria.
description: Yeast and chervil, lovage and pepper: these savory elements underpin this superspicy, smooth, ripe yet slender wine. Mature pear and stone fruit almost through come as a bous afterthought. This is the real package, showing tons of varietal character. The core is concentrated and punchy but remains toned. This is what you get from sunny days, cool nights and lots of love lavished on vines and grapes. Very impressive and utterly delicious..
