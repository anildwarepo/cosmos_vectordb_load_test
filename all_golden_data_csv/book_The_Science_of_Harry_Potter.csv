Description: Invisibility cloaks, flying broomsticks, magic doors - all the stuff of children's fantasy. But have you ever wondered if this magic could feasibly work? Roger Highfield explores the world of the Harry Potter stories and shows how cutting edge science can explain much of it. Exciting scientific concepts such as wormholes and general relativity and he also offers explanations for the more historical links between magic and science, investigating the archaelogical and anthropological evidence for witchcraft and dragons..
