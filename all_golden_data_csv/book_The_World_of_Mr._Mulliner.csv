Description: Mr Mulliner, raconteur par excellence of the Anglers' Rest, has some amazing stories to relate. Take, for example, young Lancelot. He is a bohemian - or was, until he had to look after his saintly uncle's cat Webster, and was startlingly transformed. Then there is Mulliner's brother Wilfred, a whizzo at chemistry, whose 'Magic Marvels' medicine gets him in and out of a dreadful scrape. Mervyn, not one of the brighter members of the family, has a scrap over some strawberries. Not to mention Augustine the resourceful curate, Ignatius the portrait-painter, Adrian the detective and many more besides, whose wonderful and intriguing exploits are revealed in this witty omnibus. 'Witty and effortlessly fluid. His books are laugh-out-loud funny.' Arabella Weir.
