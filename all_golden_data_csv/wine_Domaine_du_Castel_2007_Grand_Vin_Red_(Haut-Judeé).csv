description: A delicious vintage of Grand Vin, this wine shows great depth and drinkability now with the promise to age gracefully for at least another five years thanks to a ripe fruit center, medium acidity, structured tannins and superb overall balance. Black fruit and leathery spice dominate, with additional notes of black tea, licorice root, cassis and espresso grinds all fleshing out the complex and layered palate..
