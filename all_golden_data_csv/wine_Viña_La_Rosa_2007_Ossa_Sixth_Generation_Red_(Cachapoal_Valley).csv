country: Chile.
description: With spicy aromas of kirsch and dark plum accented by cedar and tobacco, this blend of Carmenère, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot is a whopper. In the mouth, it's thick and syrupy, with chewy tannins and bold flavors of baked berry and chocolate. On the finish, brown sugar and coconut enter the frame. This is ultraripe and aggressive, but it honestly exemplifies Chile at the high end. Drink now–2017; 250 cases made..
