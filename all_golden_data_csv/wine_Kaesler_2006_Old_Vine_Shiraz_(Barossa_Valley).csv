country: Australia.
description: This wine's concentrated dark fruit shows in the color—a vibrant dark garnet—and in the aromas of blueberry, vanilla and dried spices. The 16% alcohol is well concealed, manifesting only as wonderfully full, creamy density on the palate, magnifying the intense cola, earth and spice complexity. A pronounced peppery, black licorice note adds extra length to the finely textured finish. Drink now–2020..
