country: US.
description: The winery's largest vineyard, Mount Richmond encompasses 105 acres, and yet just 752 cases of the vineyard-designated version were produced in this vintage. The demanding selection process worked wonders. This is a smoky and seductive wine with aromas of incense and Asian spice. Bright, ripe cherry fruit is highlighted with a dash of dark chocolate. Subtle and elegant, this is an all-star effort from a challenging vintage..
