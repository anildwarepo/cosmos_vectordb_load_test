country: US.
description: This is the second vintage of this wine from the winery's young estate property. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec, it's locked up at present with aromas of coffee, graphite, cherry, barrel spices and licorice. The dark chocolate and cherry flavors are tightly coiled and the lightly grippy tannins are wound up. There's lot of promise there but it needs time to be realized. It will be best after 2021..
