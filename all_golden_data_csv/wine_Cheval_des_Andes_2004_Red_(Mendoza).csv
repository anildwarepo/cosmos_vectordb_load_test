country: Argentina.
description: Cheval des Andes brings together Cheval Blanc from St.-Emilion with Terrazas de los Andes, and for the past few years it has been the leader in Bordeaux-style wines from Argentina. The 2004 shows serious barrel notes framing classic aromas of aged gouda, saddle leather, mushroom and concentrated berries. The palate is structured, mildly tannic and layered with blackberry, cassis, raisin and licorice flavors. It's good now or will age nicely for another four to six years..
