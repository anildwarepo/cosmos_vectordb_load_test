country: Chile.
description: For a whiff, feel and taste of real Chile, this Carmenère-led blend is the ticket. The nose is prickly and intense, with aromas of juniper, leather and spicy black fruit. It's acidic and lively, with firm but smooth tannins and huge flavors of cassis, plum, green herbs, olive and chocolate. On the finish, it delivers structure and length, but also a final wave of herbal, Carmenère-based flavors. Drink now–2018..
