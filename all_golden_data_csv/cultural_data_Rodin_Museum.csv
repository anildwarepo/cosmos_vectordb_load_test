First Page Reviews: A+ Couldn't really ask for more. The museum itself is amazing but having the app made the experience even better. Didn't know there was an audio tour until I was in the middle of the museum and the docent even offered ear phones once she saw that I was using the app. saved us alot of time waiting in line for ticket for audio guid. (wr had museum pass). works well. good quality content audio. idea for improvement : dont stop audio on screen lock . Love it Best museum app. Emphasizes the collection with accurate photos and information.  No clutter. Recommended whether you can go there or not. Impressed! A very nice accompaniment to our visit and a nice souvenir with future learning opportunities.  Thank you!.
