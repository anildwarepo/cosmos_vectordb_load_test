wine_Bonny_Doon_2005_Le_Pousseur_Syrah_(Central_Coast),"Unnamed: 0: 5638.
country: US.
description: Here's a bone-dry, powerful young Syrah that's packed with hard tannins. The vineyard sourcing is interesting, ranging from the Sierra Foothills through Paso Robles and the Salinas Valley to the Santa Cruz Mountains. Combining the ripe fruit of warm climates with the acidity of cool regions, the wine has black currant, beef jerky, sour cherry candy, black pepper, anise and cola flavors that are quite complex. Not likely to age, but a lovely, full-bodied red to have now..
