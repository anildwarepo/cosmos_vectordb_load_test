IN THE FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA NEW SOUTH WALES DISTRICT REGISTRY NSD 539 OF 2004 NSD 543 OF 2004 NSD 540 OF 2004 NSD 94 OF 2005 BETWEEN: IEL FINANCE LIMITED, QUEENSLAND TRADING AND HOLDING COMPANY LIMITED AND SPASSKED PTY LIMITED Applicants AND: COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION Respondent JUDGE : CONTI J DATE: 29 SEPTEMBER 2006 PLACE: SYDNEY REASONS FOR ORDERS On 21 March 2006 I directed the parties to the four subject proceedings ( IEL Finance Limited and Others v Commissioner of Taxation (2006) 62 ATR 165) to provide draft declarations and/or orders giving effect to the reasons for judgment delivered on that prior occasion. The first of those four proceedings, being numbered NSD 539 of 2004 and involving IEL Finance Limited as applicant, was treated by the parties as the precedent vehicle, for the most part, for implementation of orders to be made in the remaining three proceedings. The abbreviations adopted in these reasons reflect those used in the preceding principal reasons for judgment of 21 March 2006. There appears to be no controversy between the relevant parties regarding the content of the first order to be made in all four proceedings brought of course at the instance of the applicable applicant. Nor is there controversy as to consequential orders numbered 4 to 7 concerning grant of leave to the applicant in all four proceedings to file the amended pleading and to the Commissioner filing a subsequent reply. Where controversy lies is in relation to the nature and scope of the order required to give effective operation as to the implications of the strike-out of the foregoing paragraphs of amended statement of facts, issues and contentions (the proposed order 2) and to the order to be made as to costs of this motion and of the application for summary judgment (the proposed order 3). As to what version of Order 3 as to costs should be made, the Commissioner pointed out that IEF had made no submissions at the hearing in relation to the Commissioner's claim that '[t]he applicant pay the respondent's (ie Commissioners) costs of this motion and of the application', nor led evidence concerning the need to apportion costs incurred by the respondent between issues of additional and primary tax'. The Commissioner referred to [130] of my reasons for judgment where I held that the '[t] he Commissioner must have the costs of the proceedings to date, inclusive of the costs related to the present summary application' , and submitted that the text of the orders now sought should 'reflect that finding precisely' . I think that the Commissioner's submission is correct and reflects the substance of the outcome and the implications of my principal findings made earlier on 21 March 2006 in the IEL Finance principal proceedings ( ante ). Accordingly I have made the orders in each proceedings essentially as proposed by the Commissioner. I certify that the preceding eighteen (18) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Conti.
