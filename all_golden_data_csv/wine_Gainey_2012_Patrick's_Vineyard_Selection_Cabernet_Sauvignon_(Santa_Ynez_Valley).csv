country: US.
description: This is the Gainey family's annual statement on how Bordeaux varieties can excel in the Santa Ynez Valley, and this blend of 86% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Petit Verdot and 2% Merlot is a marvelous argument. Aromas of pepper, pencil shavings, oregano, dill, elderberries, black currant and dried blueberries lead into an expertly integrated palate where black fruit is nuanced by cedar, dried oregano, crushed gravel and peppery spice..
