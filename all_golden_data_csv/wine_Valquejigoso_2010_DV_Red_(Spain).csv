country: Spain.
description: The vineyards to the immediate south of Madrid rarely produce wines like this, which is a blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon. Fully toasted, creamy aromas of fine oak accent plum and berry scents entice the nose, while this feels fresh, fruity and structured. Saucy plum and berry flavors deliver a savory aftertaste, while the finish impresses via exquisite balance, elegant dryness and spicy fruit flavors. Drink through 2022..
