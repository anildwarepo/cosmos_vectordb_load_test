country: US.
description: Fresh and leesy, this stainless steel-fermented Pinot Gris spent six months on the lees, giving it extra freshness and texture. Sweet grass and fresh herbs spread nicely across the palate, and the 15% alcohol does not register as such. In fact, if anything, this seems to fall on the lighter side of Oregon Pinot Gris, without the thick and heavy fresh cut pear character that many of them bring. Pair this with chanterelles in a light cream sauce..
