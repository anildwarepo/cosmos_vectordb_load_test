wine_Tenuta_San_Guido_2010_Sassicaia__(Bolgheri_Sassicaia),"Unnamed: 0: 108647.
country: Italy.
description: This supremely elegant and age-worthy Sassicaia opens with an intense bouquet of black cherry, Mediterranean herbs, blue flower, cedar and leather aromas. Powerful but graceful, the palate delivers a vibrant core of black cherry accented with white pepper, mineral and balsamic notes alongside youthful but polished tannins and vibrant acidity. It's not as exuberant as some of its counterparts, but it may outlive all the other Bolgheri 2010s. Drink 2018–2040..
