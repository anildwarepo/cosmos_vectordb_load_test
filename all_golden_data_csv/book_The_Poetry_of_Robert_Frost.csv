Description: A feast for lovers of American literature-the work of our greatest poet, redesigned and relaunched for a new generation of readers No poet is more emblematically American than Robert Frost. From ""The Road Not Taken"" to ""Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,"" he refined and even defined our sense of what poetry is and what it can do. T. S. Eliot judged him ""the most eminent, the most distinguished Anglo-American poet now living,"" and he is the only writer in history to have been awarded four Pulitzer Prizes. Henry Holt is proud to announce the republication of four editions of Frost's most beloved work for a new generation of poets and readers. The only comprehensive volume of Frost's verse available, comprising all eleven volumes of his poems, this collection has been the standard Frost compendium since its first publication in 1969..
