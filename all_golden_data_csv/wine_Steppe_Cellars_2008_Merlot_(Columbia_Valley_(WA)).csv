country: US.
description: At first, a rush of front-loaded plum and blackberry fruit hits the palate, then the flavors seem to sag a bit entering the midpalate. A wall of still-to-be-resolved oak leads into a hard, astringent, somewhat woody finish. Yet there is a substantial and well-built wine here, waiting to resolve its components into a more seamless whole. Retasted after being open a full day, it showed well, suggesting good aging potential..
