country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Bruwer Raats. There's a lot to like in this pretty, elegant and floral wine. It starts off with notes of bright red cherry, wild strawberry and currant, followed by supporting notes of pressed carnation, freshly turned forest floor and earthy minerality. The mouthfeel is like crushed satin, boasting fine, well-integrated tannins and bright acidity for overall balance. Hints of cured meat and baking spice unfold on the close. Drink nowâ€“2021..
