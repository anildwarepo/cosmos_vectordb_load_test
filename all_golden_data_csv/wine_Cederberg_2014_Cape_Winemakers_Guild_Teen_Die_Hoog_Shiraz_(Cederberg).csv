country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: David Nieuwoudt. There's a lot of oaky influence throughout the nose and mouth of this smooth, lush Shiraz, but it works and is balanced with the wine's other characteristics. Aromas of mocha, sweet spice, vanilla bean and toasted oak layer atop the berry preserved, macerated cherry and plum sauce core. Hints of fresh herbs and graphite add lift to the medium-weight, silky palate, alongside ample acidity. It's a sexy little number that's delicious now but should also hold well through 2021..
