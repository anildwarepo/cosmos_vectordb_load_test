country: US.
description: The workhorse wine from this Pinot master is pretty darned good, especially considering the price. Lovely, deep aromas of black cherry, tobacco, coffee and nutmeg, with a waft of vanilla-tinged oak introduce a wine that is ripe and sweet in the mouth. The vintage was a good one, and the fruit is really succulent. It's not a keeper, however, and it won't improve in the cellar, but it's so good there's no reason not to drink it all up now..
