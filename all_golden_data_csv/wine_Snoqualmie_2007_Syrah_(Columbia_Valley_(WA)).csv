wine_Snoqualmie_2007_Syrah_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 109089.
country: US.
description: Snoqualmie can legitimately lay claim to being Washington's most consistent and reliable producer of mass market, value-priced wines. This tart and racy Syrah is a fine example of the quality—no frills, but no fudging either. It tastes like fruit—blueberries and boysenberries, with some leafy, herbal tannins. In perfect balance, it's a fine every day wine with more flavor interest than most ten buck merlots and cabs..
