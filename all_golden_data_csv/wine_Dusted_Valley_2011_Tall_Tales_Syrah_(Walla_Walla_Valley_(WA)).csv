country: US.
description: From the Stoney Vine vineyard, this shows the effects of a cool vintage on young vines. There's a lot of citrus and pineapple throughout, and the berry fruit flavors, characteristic of Syrah, are present in the background. There are pleasing accents of carpaccio and peat moss, and just a hint of Bourbon from the third-use, Wisconsin oak barrels. This definitely needs extensive breathing time, or further bottle age..
