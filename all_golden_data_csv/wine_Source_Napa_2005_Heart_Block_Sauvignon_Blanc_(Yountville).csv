country: US.
description: It was barrel-fermented, using wild yeasts, and aged on the lees. The vineyard is in the coolest part of Napa Valley, and in this cool vintage, acidity is the most important part of the wine. Crisp and biting, it lends structural authority to the Meyer lemon, lime, tangerine, fig, mineral, vanilla and white pepper flavors. The alcohol level has been kept to a modest 13.8%. A welcome addition to California's Sauvignon Blanc pantheon..
