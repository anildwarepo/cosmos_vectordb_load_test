wine_Heinrich_Hartl_2015_Classic_Pinot_Noir_(Thermenregion),"Unnamed: 0: 87149.
country: Austria.
description: A promising touch of reduction still plays on the nose, riding above ripe notions of redcurrant and red cherry. The palate is ripe, mellow and smooth, showing rounded berry notes and a gentle structure supported by spicy freshness. Oak is beautifully integrated and nothing is overdone. The ripeness of the vintage is evident, but it is on the finish that this shows its true colors: a good structure and lasting freshness..
