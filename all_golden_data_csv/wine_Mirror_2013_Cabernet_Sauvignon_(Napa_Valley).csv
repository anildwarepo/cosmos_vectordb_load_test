country: US.
description: Very smooth and flavorful, this full-bodied wine pairs excellent concentration of dark-fruit flavors with subtle accents of both dark and milk chocolate. Classic varietal cues of black olive, black cherry and a faint hint of rosemary make it complex and interesting to taste. The mouthfeel strikes a good balance between firm, fine-grained tannins and a posh richness that helps the finish linger. Best after 2024..
