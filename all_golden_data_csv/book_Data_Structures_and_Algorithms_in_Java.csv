Description: Fundamental data structures in a consistent object-oriented framework Now revised to reflect the innovations of Java 5.0, Goodrich and Tamassia's Fourth Edition of Data Structures and Algorithms in Java continues to offer accessible coverage of fundamental data structures, using a consistent object-oriented framework. The authors provide intuition, description, and analysis of fundamental data structures and algorithms. Numerous illustrations, web-based animations, and simplified mathematical analyses justify important analytical concepts. Key Features of the Fourth Edition: * Updates to Java 5.0 include new sections on generics and other Java 5.0 features, and revised code fragments, examples, and case studies to conform to Java 5.0. * Hundreds of exercises, including many that are new to this edition, promote creativity and help readers learn how to think like programmers and reinforce important concepts. * New case studies illustrate topics such as web browsers, board games, and encryption. * A new early chapter covers Arrays, Linked Lists, and Recursion. * A new final chapter on Memory covers memory management and external memory data structures and algorithms. * Java code examples are used extensively, with source code provided on the website. * Online animations and effective in-text art illustrate data structures and algorithms in a clear, visual manner. Access additional resources on the web www.wiley.com/college/goodrich): * Java source code for all examples in the book * Animations * Library (net.datastructures) of Java constructs used in the book * Problems database and search engine * Student hints to all exercises in the book * Instructor resources, including solutions to selected exercises * Lecture slides.
