title: The Golden Cockerel.
text: In country far, and days long gone,There lived a famous Tsar — Dadon.When young, his strength was held in aweBy all his neighbours: he made warWhenever he declared it right.With age, he grew less keen to fight,Desiring his deserved peace: Struggle should stop; war’s clamour cease.His down-trod neighbours saw their chance,And armed with dagger, sword and lance,Attacked his frontiers at will,Making the old Tsar maintain stillAn army of twelve thousand men,With horses, weaponry, and thenAppoint highly-paid generalsTo guard the kingdom’s threatened walls.But, when they watched the west, ’twas sureThe eastern border, less secureWould be where hostile troops appeared,The danger greatest where least feared.Eastward the generals sally forth,Only to find that now the northBorder is where the danger lies.Tormented thus, Tsar Dadon criesHot tears of rage. He cannot sleep.O’er land foes stream; then from the deep.What is life worth, when so assailed?So, desperate, Dadon availedHimself of magic, turning toA sorcerer (and eunuch, too),Interpreter of omens, stars,Bird-flights, and such particulars.The courtier, sent to call the sage,Implied there’d be a handsome wage.Arrived at court, the wise old manDisclosed with confidence his plan:The golden cockerel he drewOut from his bag by magic knewWho would attack, and when, and where,Enabling generals to prepare.“Just watch and listen,” said the sage.Dadon responded: “I engage,If this be so, to grant as feeWhatever you request of me.So, set the cock, as weather-vaneUpon the highest spire. RemainWatchful, attentive; he will showYou when to arm, and where to go.Superior intelligenceWill always be the best defense.”And so it proves: whenever threatsAppear, the faithful sentry setsHis crimson crest in that directionWhence comes th’incipient insurrection.“Kiri-ku-ku,” he cries, “Hear me,And rule long years, from worry free.”Discovered once, and caused to flee,Then thrice more routed, th’enemyLose heart, respect again the willOf Tsar Dadon, their master still.A year so passes, then one more.Dadon expects another score.One dawn however, courtiers wakeThe Tsar, pale-faced, with hearts a-quake:“The cockerel, Lord, calls you to arms.Protect us, holy Tsar, from harms.”Dadon, half-sleeping, asks: “What? What?Have you your manners quite forgot?”“Forgive us, but the cock,” they say,Is adamant, brooks no delay.”The people panic. Only youCan their else-mut’nous fears subdue.Rousing himself, old Tsar DadonDeclares he’ll send his elder sonSouthward, whose army shall repelThe foe which that true cockerelHas there disclosed. “Now back to bed“The enemy’s as good as dead.”The Tsar proclaims, “I too retire.Fear not. My spy’s still on his spire.”Wars oft entail a news black-out:Was there a victory? Or rout?Who has prevailed? How stands the scoreOf dead? And were ours less or moreThan theirs? No word for seven daysThe Court’s disquietude allays.Then, on the eighth, the cockerel’sLoud cry the peace again dispels.This time his crimson comb points north.Dadon ordains to sally forthHis younger son, leading a force,So rich in armour, men and horse,That no known foe could fail to yield,Such weapons Dadon’s troops now wield.They march; are gone. Silence profoundEnvelops them, as though the groundHad opened, as it did in truth,To swallow up all Hamlin’s youthWhen its authorities displayedIndiff’rence to a promise made.Ill omen! For another weekThe golden cock’s sharp close-clamped beakSwings slowly round, clock-wise; and thenSwings just as slowly back again.But, when the eighth day dawns, the birdCrows the alarm. Grim-faced, a thirdArmy the Tsar himself leads out.Ahead, a solitary scout,Follows the blood-red setting sun.Dadon’s last campaign has begun.Long nights and days the soldiers march:Frost cramps their feet; then hot winds parchTheir throats. They seek, but find no traceOf battles, of the bloody chaseOf fugitives, of funeral mounds.No rallying cries, no trumpet’s soundsWaft to the ears of Tsar Dadon,As puzzled, tired, he trudges on.Just when he’s topped a mountain pass,Descending valley-ward,… alas!What frightful vision lies beforeHim: scattered round a silken tentLie those two armies Dadon sentIn his defence. Now all are dead;And his two sons, unhelmeted,Hold swords plunged in each other’s breast,Hatred in four glazed eyes expressed.Oh, my dear children! Who has snaredMy falcons? What magician daredVillainy in their hearts to stir,To make of each a murderer?His soldiers raise such grievous groanIt seems the very mountains moan. But then the curtains of the tentAre flung aside. The hands that rentThem, diamond-ringed and braceleted,The stately figure, noble head,Royalty’s redolence express..A Shamakhanskaya PrincessShe is, who sees Dadon, and smiles.Her beck’ning finger so beguilesHim that, bewitched, his sons forgotThe Tsar accepts his destined lot:Her rule, indeed her domination.He walks, surrendering his nation,Into the silken-wall’ed tent,Wherein his next eight nights are spentIn (who can doubt?) those rites of passionTo detail which is out of fashion,Feasting ‘tween-times on everythingOur chefs declare «fit for a king».At last begins the homeward course.The maiden, mounted on his horse,Caresses the still-love-sick Tsar.The soldiers grumble; yet they areEager to tell their waiting friends(With what imagination lendsTheir memories) fantastic stuffAnd nonsense. Sure, they’ve seen enough!Rumours have reached the capitalBefore them. At its drawbridge, allThe people wait in trepidationTo see the ruler of the nationApproaching with his new consort,Of whom men variously reportShe is a witch, a whore, a queen.Never before have such things been.They greet their Tsar. His grave saluteBefits his rank; but his acuteEye has detected in the crowdThat eunuch-sage whose cockerel’s loudUproar had saved the threatened state.“Approach, old man,” Dadon invites,“I grant whatever gift requitesYou for your golden cockerelWhose sentry-duty served so well.”“I just desire,” the wizard says,The Shamakhanskaya Princess.Come now, my lady, we must leave.”Th’astonished Tsar cannot believeHis ears. “What? what? Take my princess?And you a eunuch! I confessI never heard a better joke.But seriously, when I spokeOf paying you right handsomelyI also meant in reason. See,I’ll give you half my treasury;A lordship; and, if lecheryIndeed attracts you, all the whoresWhom you can satisfy.”With forceThe wizard answers: “SatisfiedI’ll be only with her as bride.Give me the Shamakhan Princess.I’ll be content with nothing less.”“Take nothing then,”Tsar Dadon said.His sword-swipe smote the old man dead.The crowd was dumbstruck; but the maid,By this aggression undismayed,Burst out in laughter, peal on peal,As though by laughing to revealHer full involvement in the planTo trick and then destroy a man.The Tsar, though startled, deigns to smile.Then on, along the Royal Mile.The crowd begins a careful cheer,Until a whir of wings they hearAnd see a bird with lance-like beak,A golden bird, with feathers sleek,Dive at the Tsar, piercing his head.Dadon groans once, falls, and is dead.Where’s she who was to be his queen?Vanished, as though she’d never been.The story’s false; but in it liesSome truth, seen but by inward eyes..
