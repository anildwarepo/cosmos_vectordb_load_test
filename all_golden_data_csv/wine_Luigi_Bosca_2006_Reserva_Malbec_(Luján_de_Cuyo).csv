wine_Luigi_Bosca_2006_Reserva_Malbec_(Luján_de_Cuyo),"Unnamed: 0: 50596.
country: Argentina.
description: Reserved on the nose, with a hint of rhubarb and bramble. But where this wine really fails to impress is on the palate. It's sharp and underdeveloped, with tart cherry aromas and piercing acidity. Some mocha and vanilla come on late to help things along, but by then the wine has defined itself as borderline sour and miserly. Unusually short on fruit for Luigi Bosca, a winery we've come to like. Imported by Multiple U.S. Importers..
