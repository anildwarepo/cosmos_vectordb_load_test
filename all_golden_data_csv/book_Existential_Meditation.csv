Description: In this three-part discourse, Simon Cleveland offers a perspective on life derived partly from the latest scientific theories in cosmology and quantum mechanics and partly from analysis on the works of some of the greatest writers and philosophers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The book explores topics such as the meaning of time, consciousness and the development of the essence. The author also examines the genesis of the concept of immortality..
