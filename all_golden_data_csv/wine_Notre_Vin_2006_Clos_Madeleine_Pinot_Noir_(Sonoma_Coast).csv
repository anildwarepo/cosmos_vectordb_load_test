country: US.
description: This is a unique Pinot Noir, different from almost everything else out there. Sourced from a vineyard in the Petaluma Gap region (perhaps a future AVA), it's bone dry, moderate in alcohol, and tannic. It has lighter, leaner flavors than most Pinots, with the fruit accompanied by herbs, minerals, flowers and mushrooms. Fans of super-fruity Pinots will find it unrich, but Burgundy lovers may think of Pommard. It will be fascinating to track this wine's progress..
