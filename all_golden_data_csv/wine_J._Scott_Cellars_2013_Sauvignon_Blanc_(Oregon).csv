country: US.
description: The winery does well with this grape, though each new vintage brings some sort of a twist or turn as far as grape sourcing, blend and overall style are concerned. Pungent with fusel oil and grass, it's not for the faint of palate. Full and flavorful on the palate, it combines sweet grasses with tree fruits, citrus and rind, showing excellent concentration and length, and finishing with a hint of ginger cookie..
