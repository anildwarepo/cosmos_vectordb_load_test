country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Gary Jordan. This is rich and ripe from the start, with intense aromas of cassis, black plum and berry that mingle with notes of charred meat, bacon and cigar box. Thick and mouthfilling but not overdone, it offers structured but ripe tannins and dense black-fruit flavors that are graced with hits of espresso and bittersweet chocolate on the finish. It's approachable now, but should age well through 2023..
