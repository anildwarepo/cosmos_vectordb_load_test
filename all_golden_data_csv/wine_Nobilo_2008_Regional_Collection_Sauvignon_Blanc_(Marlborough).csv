country: New Zealand.
description: With more than a quarter of million cases of this wine coming to the U.S., Nobilo's Regional Collection SB will turn up on a lot of tables over the summer—and justifiably so. It's a very good rendition of Marlborough Sauvignon, offering grassy aromas and flavors backed by lime and grapefruit. It's plump enough to have mass appeal, with a refreshingly crisp finish. Like almost all NZ Savvies, it should be consumed over the next 6–9 months..
