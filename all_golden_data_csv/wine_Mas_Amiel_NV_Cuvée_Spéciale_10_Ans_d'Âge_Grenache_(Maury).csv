country: France.
description: Aged in glass demijohns for one year and oak tuns for nine, this is a mature selection that's ready to drink now, though it can certainly keep for many more years to come. A beautiful rancio characteristic leads, with aromas of walnut shell, orange oil and earthy spice fill the bouquet. Skin-driven fruit flavors of cherry and plum dominate the gripping palate, while the complex finish reveals accents of black tea, licorice root and baking spice..
