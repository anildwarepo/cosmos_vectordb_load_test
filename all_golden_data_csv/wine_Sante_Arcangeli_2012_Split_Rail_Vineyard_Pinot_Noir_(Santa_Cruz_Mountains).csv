country: US.
description: With a pale color and mouthwatering acidity, this delicately structured Pinot goes well beyond its immediate flavors of raspberry tea, pomegranates, persimmons, orange peel, exotic spices and oak to offer a Burgundian touch of earth and mushrooms. There's also a firm, stony minerality on the palate. This gorgeous Pinot was produced in tiny quantities of 300 cases and will drink well over the next six years..
