country: Australia.
description: Astralis has become one of Australia's top collectibles, and Roman Bratasiuk's 2005 version is once again top-shelf stuff. It's full-bodied and rich without being over the top, balancing dark-chocolate-covered blackberries and blueberries with more complex savory notes (spice, grilled meat). While it's a big, hulking wine at first, the finish shows great elegance and finesse, ending with silky tannins. Best from 2014. Imported by Wine Brokers Unlimited..
