country: US.
description: A bit of skin contact gives this Viognier some extra character and texture. Quite aromatic on the nose, peach and pineapple juice aromas are shot through with pink peppercorns and grapefruit spray. The rich palate shows good acidic verve, however it feels slightly hot. Notes of jasmine show up on the midpalate leading to a slight astringent bitterness. In the end, fruit tones prevail and linger on a moderate finish..
