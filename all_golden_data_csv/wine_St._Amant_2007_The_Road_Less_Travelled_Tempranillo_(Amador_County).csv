country: US.
description: This 100% Tempranillo will linger with you for a while, a real thinking wine that takes time to reveal its power. Properly tannic—have a hearty meal at the ready—the St. Amant is structurally sound and yet concentrated with sweet notes of toffee, vanilla and brown sugar on the finish, its dark fruit both subtle and ripe. From the foothills of Amador County on a relatively cool site, the wine is aged in both French and American oak (35% new)..
