unesco_heritage_Old_City_of_Sana'a,"Name: Old City of Sana'a.
short_description: <p>Situated in a mountain valley at an altitude of 2,200 m, Sana’a has been inhabited for more than 2,500 years. In the 7th and 8th centuries the city became a major centre for the propagation of Islam. This religious and political heritage can be seen in the 103 mosques, 14 <em>hammams</em> and over 6,000 houses, all built before the 11th century. Sana’a’s many-storeyed tower-houses built of rammed earth (<em>pisé</em>) add to the beauty of the site.</p>.
