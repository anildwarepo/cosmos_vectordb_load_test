country: US.
description: This unique blend of Dundee Hill Pinot Noir and Walla Walla Syrah seduces instantly with a bouquet redolent of smoke and licorice, tobacco and vanilla. Though it's Syrah that seems dominant, adding flavors of supple purple fruits to the aromatic mix, it seems apparent that the Pinot Noir component extends the finish, turning a potent and powerful wine into one that exits with delicacy and breeding..
