country: Argentina.
description: As far as Argentine Syrah goes, this vintage of Iscay, which contains 3% Viognier in a nod to France, is the new benchmark for the country. Daniel Pi and Joey Tensley's wine discloses aromas of jammy berry fruits along with cardamom and floral notes. The palate is a fortress of layers, while flavors of blackberry, cassis and chocolate set the stage for finishing notes of vanilla, butter, espresso and cocoa powder. Drink through 2018..
