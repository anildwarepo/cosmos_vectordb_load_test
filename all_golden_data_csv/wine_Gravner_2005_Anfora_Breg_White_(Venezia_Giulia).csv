country: Italy.
description: Gravner's Breg (Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio and Riesling Italico) shows Sauternes-like aromas of honey, candied apricot, butterscotch, caramel and almond paste. The wine delivers a pretty orange color with copper highlights (it is famously aged in clay amphorae) with firm but velvety rich tannins. The finish is long and smooth and there's a very beautiful touch of drying mineral on the close. Hold five more years at least..
