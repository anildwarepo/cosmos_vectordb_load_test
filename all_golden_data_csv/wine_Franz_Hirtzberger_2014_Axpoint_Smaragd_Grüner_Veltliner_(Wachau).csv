country: Austria.
description: Deliciously ripe and juicy pear mingles with yellow plum and greengage on the nose. The palate, conversely, is held tight in a bright citrus corset featuring grapefruit, lemon and barely ripe tangerine: a layered mix of enticing, zesty flavors that refresh and scintillate. White pepper and some herbal spice just manage to edge in and will develop more fully with time. Clean, taut and very exciting..
