country: US.
description: With elaborate oak, concentrated fruit, dense tannins and exquisite balance, this tiny production Cabernet—the winery's first-ever reserve—demands to be cellared. It's completely dry and rich in blackberries, black currants, baking chocolate, anise and minerals. It feels dramatic from the start, like the opening notes of a great symphony or rock song. Cellar it for at least eight years, and it could age well beyond that..
