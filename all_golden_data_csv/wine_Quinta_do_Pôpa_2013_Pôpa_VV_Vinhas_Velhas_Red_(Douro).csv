country: Portugal.
description: Pôpa was the family's nickname for grandpa. The winery, run by grandson Stéphane Ferreira, is the grandkids' tribute. This richly perfumed wine, by consultant Luis Pato, comes from a field blend of 21 grape varieties. Old vines with an average age of 82-years-old in a single parcel have given the wine huge concentration and rich swathes of tannins and black plum and damson fruit. The wine has power while also retaining plenty of elegance. It is an impressive wine, just approaching its peak and ready from 2018..
