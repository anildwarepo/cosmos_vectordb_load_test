description: This luminous and unique Chenin Blanc straw wine is a real stunner, showing an upfront and approachable character as well as hidden layers of nuanced herbs and the potential to develop additional complexities with time. Heady notes of toasted brioche, dried apricot, gingered orange peel and baking spice abound throughout, with great richness and a lush texture in the mouth. Intense but balanced; it can be enjoyed now or cellared for up to ten years..
