country: US.
description: A compelling wine. Made from this Bordeaux blending variety seldom seen bottled on its own, the grapes were grown in the Stagecoach Vineyard, high up on Atlas Peak, increasingly a source of some of Napa's greatest red wines. The style is thoroughly modern, with soft tannins and rich flavors of chocolate, black cherries, cassis and new oak, as well as a pleasing charred meatiness. Hard to tell where it's going, but delicious now. Decant for an hour or two before serving..
