Description: A vivid narrative history captures the multicultural world of Salonica, from its heyday as a Byzantine port, through its role as a progressive center of the Ottoman Empire, to its occupation during World War II by the Nazis, revealing how its position as a center of progressive equality among diverse cultures and religions was gradually eroded, culminating in the Nazis' destruction of its Jewish inhabitants.
