country: US.
description: This portion of the winery's vineyard always yields Cabernets of enormous concentration with hard tannins. The 2009 is a classic, detonating in the mouth with laserlike blackberry and cassis flavors, to which new oak brings additional richness of smoky cedar. It's really a beautiful wine, but very tannic, even by Von Strasser standards. Give it at least eight years, and it could be drinking well 20 years from now..
