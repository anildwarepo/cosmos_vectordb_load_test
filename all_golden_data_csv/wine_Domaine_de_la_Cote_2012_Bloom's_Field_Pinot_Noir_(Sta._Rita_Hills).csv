country: US.
description: This winery is at the extreme edge of the pick-early, low-alcohol movement, which can make the wines challenging for the usual California Pinot fan. But this Pinot begins on familar territory, with heady aromas of dried violet and scarlet rose, damp forest floor, and cinnamon-laced cranberry sauce, managing to be both brisk and funky. The flavors are light and tart, but will pick up more savory characteristics from 2018â€“2024..
