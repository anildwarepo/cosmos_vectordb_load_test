wine_Johanneshof_Reinisch_2014_Rotgipfler_(Thermenregion),"Unnamed: 0: 82173.
country: Austria.
description: A rather subdued nose leads to a rounded palate flavored by savory yeast, subtle pepper and thyme. A wine with this sort of textured mouth-feel simply cries out for food. Its zingy freshness will cut through any richness while its subtle aromatics of red apple and herb will complement but not overpower flavors. This indigenous Austrian original will do justice to just about any kind of European cuisine..
