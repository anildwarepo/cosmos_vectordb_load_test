wine_Palmina_2009_Nebbiolo_(Santa_Barbara_County),"Unnamed: 0: 91846.
country: US.
description: Not only is this appellation blend the cheaper Nebbiolo offered by Steve Clifton's Italian varietal-focused winery, it's the best right out of the bottle. Bright strawberry, sweet rose, leather, star anise, cardamom, black-cherry-laced gingerbread and vanilla show on the rich and full nose. The tannins part to open dried strawberry, plum, rose hip and earthy flavors, proving both manly in presence but feminine in delicacy..
