country: US.
description: The result of an accidental planting of these two varieties in the same block, this blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Syrah provides prime evidence why these two grapes make for a dynamic duo. Aromas of roasted coffee, black-cherry paste, Dr Pepper, vanilla and elderberry prove both juicy and elegant. With a silky mouthfeel and polished acidity, the palate is layered with blueberry, blackcurrant, tobacco, leather and dark-chocolate flavors..
