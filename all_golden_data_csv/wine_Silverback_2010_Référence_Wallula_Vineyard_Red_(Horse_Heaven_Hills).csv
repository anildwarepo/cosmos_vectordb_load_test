country: US.
description: This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (43%), Merlot (31%), Petit Verdot (12%), Cabernet Franc (9%) and Malbec was assembled after just a little more than a year in barrel and then aged for an additional year in 500-liter French oak puncheons. It's 85% free-run juice and locked up with notes of graphite, dark chocolate, cassis and wood. The flavors are elegant, tart and tightly coiled, surrounded by chewy tannins that still need some time in the bottle to be tamed..
