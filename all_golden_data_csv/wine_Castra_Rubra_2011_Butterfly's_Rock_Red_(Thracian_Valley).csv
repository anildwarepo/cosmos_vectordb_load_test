country: Bulgaria.
description: The result of a joint project between Michel Rolland and Jair Agopian, this Bulgarian Bordeaux-style blend has primary aromas of ripe blackberry, dark cherry and black plum that give way to intriguing secondary notes of saddle leather, tobacco leaf and graphite. It exhibits nice weight on the midpalate with juicy flavors of cassis, black raspberry and cherry vanilla. The tannins are firm yet velvety and there is a surprising burst of bright fruit in the finish..
