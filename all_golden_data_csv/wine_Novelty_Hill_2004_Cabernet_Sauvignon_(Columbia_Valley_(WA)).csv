wine_Novelty_Hill_2004_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 105187.
country: US.
description: A dark and spicy wine, with streaks of mineral and herb buried within very tart, acidic black fruit. This is complex, quite youthful and tightly woven. I think it will require some years to pull itself together, but the balance is here, in a medium-bodied style, showing some herb, some citrus and plenty of muscle. Tasted over many hours after being decanted, it showed itself to be a wonderful wine that developed multiple layers of flavor..
