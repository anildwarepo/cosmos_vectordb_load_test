country: England.
description: A restrained but impressive notion of honeyed oatmeal on the nose makes for a promising opening. A crisp green-apple note plays alongside ripe lemon. The palate shows fine, elegant mousse, amplifying those restrained aromas of honey, oatmeal and biscuit. This wine is at a perfect juncture of freshness and evolution, with wonderfully developed autolytic notes and great balance. The finish is long and moreish..
