country: Spain.
description: Very big, modern, sweet and oaky. And that doesn't mean it's bad, because the richness, high alcohol (15%), buttery barrel notes and candy-like qualities are all rendered well. Still, be on the watch for creamy oak, cinnamon, caf√© mocha and butter more than precise, angular fruit character. Should get more integrated with another year of bottle age. The boisterous blend is Garnacha, Syrah and Mazuelo..
