wine_Rosenhof_2013_Ausbruch_Welschriesling_(Burgenland),"Unnamed: 0: 129068.
country: Austria.
description: Despite its pale, white color this Ausbruch emanates notes of dried Medjool dates and dark raisins. Currant and golden sultana also get their due. Brighter sweetness illuminates the poised palate that is lit up with fresh acidity. All the while the rich, sweet, sumptuous and dark caramel notes provide a sonorous background. Evidence to what giddy heights a Welschriesling (not related to Riesling) can rise. The finish comes with a satisfying fillip of apricots. This is unusual and should spur the curiosity of sweet wine lovers..
