country: US.
description: Lots of sweet berry flavors and equally large doses of fine-grained tannins are the opposite poles in this full-bodied blend. It smells like boysenberry and blackberry jam, with similar fruit notes on the palate. Then very firm tannins kick in, making the texture at once blanketing and a bit drying. This has so much flavor that time in the bottle will tame some of those tannins and leave plenty of character to enjoy. Best after 2019..
