country: US.
description: This particular block was first planted in 2007, so these are young vines. Sometimes fruit from young vines will burst forth in spectacular fashion, and that's the case here. Supremely aromatic, this opens with a velvety mix of Asian spices, fruit leather, plum, cherry, cocoa powder and coffee grounds. All this and more can be tasted as well as sniffed, with excellent penetration through a lingering, cedary finish..
