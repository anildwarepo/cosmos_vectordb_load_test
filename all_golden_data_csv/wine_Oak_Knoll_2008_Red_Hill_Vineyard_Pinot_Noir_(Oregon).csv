country: US.
description: From a vineyard in southern Oregon that is actually its own, self-contained AVA (Red Hill Douglas County), this wine is approaching full maturity at 5+ years of age. Soft, round and rather delicate, it has the light color and pleasant charm of a simple Bourgogne. Rhubarb, pomegranate, cherry, white pepper and a splash of root beer capture your interest; there is more going on than you'd suspect at first sip..
