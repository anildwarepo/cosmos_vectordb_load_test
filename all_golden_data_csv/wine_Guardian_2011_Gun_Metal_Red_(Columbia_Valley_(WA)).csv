country: US.
description: A Bordeaux-style blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this also holds small amounts of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Sourced from the Conner Lee and Stonetree vineyards, it's supple, smooth and textural, with elegant, perfectly ripened fruit and a judicious application of two-thirds new French oak. It captures the elegance, restraint and overall structure of the challenging (and rewarding) 2011 vintage..
