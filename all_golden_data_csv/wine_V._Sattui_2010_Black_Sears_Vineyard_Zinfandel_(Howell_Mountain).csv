country: US.
description: When it comes to sheer extracted power, Zinfandel doesn't get more massive than this. Several things come together. Zin's wild, briary flavors of currants and raisins are here with fantastic concentration, along with notes of licorice, bitter dark chocolate and exotic spices. Howell Mountain's famously hard tannins co-star. The alcohol is high and heady, and discloses itself with jalape√±o pepper heat. Not for everyone, but a great evocation of its style..
