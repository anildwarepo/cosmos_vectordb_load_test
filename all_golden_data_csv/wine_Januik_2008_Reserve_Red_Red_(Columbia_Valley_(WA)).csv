wine_Januik_2008_Reserve_Red_Red_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 83364.
country: US.
description: Januik's reserve is a blend of 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, and 2% Cabernet Franc. Sourced from Champoux and Weinbau, just three barrels were made. The fruit is deeply flavored with black cherry and cassis, and the tannins seem darker, earthier, toastier and overall fuller than any of the other excellent Januik reds. Still young and tight, this promises to blossom over time with floral, earth, barrel and spice highlights..
