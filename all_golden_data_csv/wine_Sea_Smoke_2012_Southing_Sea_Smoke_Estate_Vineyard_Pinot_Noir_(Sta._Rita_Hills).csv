country: US.
description: Named after the famed vineyard's south-facing slopes, this vintage is expertly crafted, with aromas of ripe red cherry, sandalwood, black pepper, graphite, purple flowers and damp pine needles. It's complex, with dark red fruit and tickling cardamom spice set against fine-grained tannins. Quite precise and tight now, the violet and rose petal elements will expand beautifully with time, so drink 2019â€“2025..
