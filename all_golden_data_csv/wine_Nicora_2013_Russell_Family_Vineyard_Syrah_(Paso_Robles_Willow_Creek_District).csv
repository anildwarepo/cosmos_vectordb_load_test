description: Pure purple aromas of boysenberry jam and Concord grapes swirl amidst melted dark chocolate, maple-drizzled bacon and touches of beef carpaccio on the nose of this bottling from a coveted vineyard. Starting with strong blueberry and blackberry fruit, the palate then sizzles with acidity through the fine-grained tannic structure. The midpalate shows meaty depth with roasting herbs and minty lift throughout..
