country: US.
description: Camaspelo is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, blended with 20% Merlot. The fruit shines through brightly in this cooler vintage, black cherry and plum with a saline minerality. The wine saw 40% new oak, perhaps for the last time, as Christophe Baron believes “the barrel is dead” and is moving to all-neutral, large format foudres, puncheons and concrete. Soft, supple and sensuous, this is a delicious wine drinking quite nicely already..
