country: US.
description: Since planting in 1997, Bucher Vineyard has been a renowned source of Pinot Noir for exceptional local wineries. Now the Bucher family is making their own wine, with good results. The wine is dry, fresh and keen in acidity, and has considerable weight, with ripe, forward raspberry, cherry, bacon, saut√©ed wild mushroom and exotic spice flavors. However, it's still too young. Begin to enjoy it around 2018..
