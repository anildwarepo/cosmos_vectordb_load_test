wine_Gérard_Bertrand_2008_La_Forge_Red_(Corbières-Boutenac),"Unnamed: 0: 117218.
country: France.
description: There's a strong mineral backbone to this wine, which alongside notes of garrigue (think lavender and bay leaves) and purple violet florals highlight this fantastic terroir. Black cherry, plum, licorice stick and black peppercorns flood the palate, while hints of used coffee grinds, cocoa powder and graham cracker crust appear on the seriously long finish. Creamy and decadent but balanced; easy to drink now but will age gracefully..
