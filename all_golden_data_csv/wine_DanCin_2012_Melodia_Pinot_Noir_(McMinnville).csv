wine_DanCin_2012_Melodia_Pinot_Noir_(McMinnville),"Unnamed: 0: 117841.
country: US.
description: With fruit sourced from the excellent Hyland Vineyard, this blends a pair of Dijon clones and was aged in half new French oak for 15 months. Black cherry and cola syrup flavors combine in a sappy, concentrated midpalate. Highlights of underbrush and balsamic add flavor interest, and the dry, polished tannins frame the flavors perfectly. There's every reason to believe this can age well, but why wait?.
