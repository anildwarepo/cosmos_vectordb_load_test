country: US.
description: Saggi is the super Tuscan entry in the Long Shadows portfolio, made by Ambrogio and Giovanni Folonari. Here it is a blend of 45% Sangiovese, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Syrah —not much different from 2007. Smoky in the nose, broadly fruity in the mouth, with an attractive mix of black cherry fruit and bacon fat highlights. It fades a bit in the finish, and there is just the faintest hint of onion..
