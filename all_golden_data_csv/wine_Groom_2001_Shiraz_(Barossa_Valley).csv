country: Australia.
description: Classic Aussie Shiraz from the vineyard that borders the backbone vineyard of Penfold's Grange. This one's made by ex-Grange winemaker Daryl Groom, who now lives in California's Sonoma County but owns his own Australia vineyard. Lush, deep, rich and ripe, the wine fans out to reveal complex layers of black cherry, plum, licorice, spice, chocolate, blackberry, tar, vanilla, coconut and herbs. Smooth and plush textured, with a finish that doesn't quit..
