wine_Freemark_Abbey_2005_Bosché_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Rutherford),"Unnamed: 0: 127578.
country: US.
description: Drier and earthier than many Napa Cabs these days, this wine has subtle sage and sweet licorice that grounds its fruitier flavors of blackberries, cherries and raspberries. Very beautiful are the tannins, which are rich and pure, suggesting perfect ripeness. The small Bosché bottling has been a premier one for the winery for many years, and this '05 is one of the best in memory. Should age effortlessly for at least a dozen years..
