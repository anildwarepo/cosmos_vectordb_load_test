country: Austria.
description: An enticing smell of lemon sorbet fills the nose and the effect on the palate is much the same: bracing, cleansing deliciousness pervades everything. There is a hint of crunchy, crisp green apple combined with far richer notions of lemon zest and mandarin peel. Deeper down resides an earthy, yeasty core and a salty, stoniness. This is very young now and will show its true but thrilling citrus-tinted colors with some bottle age. Drink 2018–2025..
