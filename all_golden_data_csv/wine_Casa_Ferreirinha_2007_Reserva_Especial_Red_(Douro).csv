country: Portugal.
description: This Ferreirinha Douro Superior wine is made in exceptional years. The 2007 is the 16th vintage since 1960 (the previous release was 2003). It is an immense wine in its grandeur while being sophisticated and structured. There are complex flavors from the long wood aging. The dark, dense black fruits are impressive while perfectly meshed into the concentrated tannins and black currant acidity. This wine, even at nine years, is young, and should not be drunk before 2020 (or decanted if you can't wait)..
