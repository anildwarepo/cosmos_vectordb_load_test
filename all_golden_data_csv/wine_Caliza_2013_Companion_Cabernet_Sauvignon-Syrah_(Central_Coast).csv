country: US.
description: This is a hearty, lavishly styled blend of 54% Cabernet Sauvignon and 46% Syrah by Carl Bowker, who pushes the purple-fruit aromas to the max, with deep blueberry, cr√®me de cassis and violet flowers on the nose. The palate touches a wide range of dark fruits such as boysenberry, olallieberry and elderberry, picking up cola and root beer along the way. It finishes on coffee and a touch of elderflower, with an extremely soft texture..
