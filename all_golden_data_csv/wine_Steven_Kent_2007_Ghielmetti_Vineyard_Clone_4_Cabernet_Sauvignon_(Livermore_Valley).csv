country: US.
description: There's a beautiful wine in here, but it's buried under tannins. Also, the fruit is all primary blackberry, blueberry, raspberry and cherry jam, while the oak stands to the side, insistent in vanilla and toast. Nothing has merged, everything is separated. Yet this is a great wine, easily the greatest Cabernet to emerge from Livermore Valley in memory. Beautiful now, and should develop for a decade..
