country: Austria.
description: The bitter-edged sweetness of botrytis counters the luscious notes of orange marmalade. The palate is of immense richness and has a tart gilded richness of candied orange peel and a concentrated pleasant bitterness that is so addictive. There are glints of white pepper. The purest citrus acid runs like a fault line through the wine. This is lovely and luscious now but really made to last. This will age and develop indefinitely. Drink now until 2030 at least..
