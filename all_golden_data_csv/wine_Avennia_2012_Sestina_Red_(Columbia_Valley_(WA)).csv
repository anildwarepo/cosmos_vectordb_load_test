wine_Avennia_2012_Sestina_Red_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 28249.
country: US.
description: This standout wine is 72% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Merlot and 9% Cabernet Franc mostly from old blocks at Dionysus, Red Willow and Bacchus vineyards. It's youthful with aromas of toasty barrel spices, dark roasted coffee and high-toned savory herbs. Flavors are light and restrained while still showing a lot of richness, with the dark fruit notes backed by mouthwatering acids. Just a baby now, this is a 20-year wine that should start to strut its stuff after 2024. Give it a 24-hour decant if opening it in the near term..
