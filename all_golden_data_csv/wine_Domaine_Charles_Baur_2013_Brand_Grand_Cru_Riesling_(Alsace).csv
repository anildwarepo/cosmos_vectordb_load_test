wine_Domaine_Charles_Baur_2013_Brand_Grand_Cru_Riesling_(Alsace),"Unnamed: 0: 38452.
country: France.
description: There is the merest hint of chamomile lift on the nose, pulling all the other flavors heavenwards with it. There is apple as well as lemon zest. The palate is wonderfully pure and totally dry. Here and there more herbal inflections show and more mellow hints of baked apple. This is dry, taut and aromatic, but also clean-cut and precise. Lovely now but with definite aging potential. Drink now through 2030..
