country: France.
description: A medicinal lift precedes any notion of fruit on the nose which only hints at juicy ripe peach. The palate has the full hit of fruit with lovely quinine and peach pit bitterness thrown in as a counterbalance to the luscious, concentrated and powerful sweetness. With time, hints of lemony barley sugar and toffee come through. This is full-on and intense with incredible sweetness and length. The flavor just lasts and lasts with a stony warm persistence..
