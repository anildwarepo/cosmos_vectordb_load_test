description: Known for working well with the grape, this Raats wine is Cabernet Franc dominant (85%), with additional components of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Merlot. Forward scents of green pepper, tobacco leaf, cigar ash and menthol are framed by a fruity spice of blackberry and cassis. The medium-weight mouthfeel is approachable yet structured, with fine-grain tannins and a licorice-infused, brambly berry finish. Drink nowâ€“2019..
