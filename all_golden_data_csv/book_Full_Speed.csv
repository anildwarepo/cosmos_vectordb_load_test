Description: Treat yourself to FULL SPEED by Janet Evanovich and Charlotte Hughes. Praise for the FULL series: 'A fine romance with plenty of kisses' Mirror; 'A wild mix of intrigue, sex and pyrotechnics' The Times Their enemies haven't got a prayer... Journalist Jamie Swift and millionaire Max Holt drive each other crazy when they work together - but they just can't stop. Especially when they both have their reasons for wanting to investigate a charismatic preacher with suspected ties to the Mob and a long history with his female church members. The trouble is, someone has got wind of Jamie and Max's snooping around, and is pretty eager to introduce them to their Maker - a lot sooner than either Jamie or Max had planned....
