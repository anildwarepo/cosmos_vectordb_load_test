country: US.
description: Merlot makes up three-quarters of this blend, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon (21%) and Cabernet Franc. It starts out a bit reduced, providing some initial distraction from its aromas of plum, herb, asphalt and currant. The blue-fruit and smoke flavors show a sense of plushness, with savory notes lingering on the finish. The tannins bring some grip. It provides enjoyment but the Merlot doesn't really pop and the smoky notes seem out of place..
