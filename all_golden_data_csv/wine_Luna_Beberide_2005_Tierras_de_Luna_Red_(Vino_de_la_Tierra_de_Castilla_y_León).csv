country: Spain.
description: This is Luna Beberide's “kitchen sink” blend consisting of Mencia, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine has blackberry and violet aromas, and as a whole it's inviting and smooth. Flavors of berry fruit are solid but modest, while herbal accents and baking spice notes jazz things up. With more follow-through and some artistic touches, this could be even better. As is, it's a perfectly good red blend..
