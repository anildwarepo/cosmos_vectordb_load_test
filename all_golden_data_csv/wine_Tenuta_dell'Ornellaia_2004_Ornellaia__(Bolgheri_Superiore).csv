country: Italy.
description: This is a hopelessly gorgeous wine with so much energy, intensity, density and good cheer. The superb ensemble—Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot—delivers chocolate fudge, ripe cherry, rhubarb, cola, tobacco and cedar wood. It's tight and supple, with seamless harmony and excellent succulence on the finish. But it's that incredible intensity that truly sets this wine apart..
