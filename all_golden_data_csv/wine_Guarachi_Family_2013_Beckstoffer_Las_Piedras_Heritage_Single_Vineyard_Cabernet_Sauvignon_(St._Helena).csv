country: US.
description: A stunning effort from Beckstoffer's famously gravelly site, this is a 100% varietal wine from one clone, made in a tiny amount. Exquisite aromas of blackberry and leather surround a velvety texture and spiky acidity, the tannins integrated and lengthy, with room to grow over time. Powerfully full bodied, this is a classic representation of the valley in expansive celebration of a ridiculously good vintage. Drink now through 2023..
