country: US.
description: There's lots of lush Cabernet Sauvignon character in this smooth Bordeaux blend. It has the all-important quality of impeccable texture, as soft as velvet, yet firm in minerals. With about one-third Cabernet Franc, it shows flavors ranging from cherries and currants to sweet cassis liqueur, with a complex veneer of new French oak. Beautiful to drink now, and it should age effortlessly for the next 10 years..
