country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Louis Nel. This Cab-Shiraz blend is somewhat closed at present, with muted dark-fruit aromas that suggest blackberry, boysenberry and plum. Mouthfilling, gripping tannins produce a tight, firm structure, while hints of blackcurrant liqueur, bittersweet chocolate and cigar box softly unfold on the close. This should develop and become more pronounced with some time in the cellar; try after 2020..
