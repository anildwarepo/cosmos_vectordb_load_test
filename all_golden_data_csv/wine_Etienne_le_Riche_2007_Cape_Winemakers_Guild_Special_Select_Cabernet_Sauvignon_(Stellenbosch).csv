country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Etienne le Riche. Pleasantly herbal tones of fynbos, mint, licorice root and violet grace the black cherry and boysenberry fruit core of this wine. The medium-weight mouthfeel offers gripping but not overbearing tannins, with ripe black-fruit tones that flesh out the palate. Final notes of bittersweet cocoa, wood spice and a touch of tobacco linger long on the close. It's mature enough to enjoy now, though it should continue to age well through 2021..
