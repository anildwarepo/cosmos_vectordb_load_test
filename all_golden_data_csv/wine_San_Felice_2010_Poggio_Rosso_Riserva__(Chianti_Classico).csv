country: Italy.
description: Here's an outstanding Chianti Classico made from 80% Sangiovese, 10% Pugnitello and 10% Colorino that opens with earthy aromas of underbrush, leather, violet, dark spices and red berries. The structured palate delivers rich black cherry, black pepper, clove and balsamic herbs alongside bracing yet refined tannins. It still shows some youthful aggression, so give it time to soften and develop complexity. Drink 2015–2025..
