wine_Bodegas_Peñafiel_2005_Miros__(Ribera_del_Duero),"Unnamed: 0: 63194.
country: Spain.
description: Slightly volatile and jammy, but still good for the price range. The nose is pungent and mildly prickly, but it settles in the long run. Like most RDDs, it's intense and jammy in the mouth, with concentration and flavors of raspberry, tomato, salad dressing and even chocolate. If all this sounds a bit scattered and all over the map, it is. But as a whole, the wine has composure, mouthfeel and varietal and regional character..
