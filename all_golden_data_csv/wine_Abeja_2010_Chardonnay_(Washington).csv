wine_Abeja_2010_Chardonnay_(Washington),"Unnamed: 0: 54763.
country: US.
description: Abeja's Chardonnays are as certain to hit their target as a Kobe Bryant slam dunk, and the style remains consistent vintage after vintage. Spicy, nutty, based around stone fruits and melon, they do not shy away from the toasty flavors that derive from barrel fermentation in 40% new French oak. The underlying minerality and well-balanced acidity mark this as Washington fruit, most of it from the outstanding Conner Lee vineyard..
