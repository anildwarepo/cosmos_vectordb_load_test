country: US.
description: The sixth release of this outstanding reserve holds firm to the well-established style. Bright, tart, ripe and compact red-berry fruit is set against firm, polished tannins. Still young and hard, it needs plenty of breathing time, or better yet, cellar it for a few years. Tim Stevens's reds have proven ageworthy, and this earthy, smoky, textural and well-crafted effort should improve for a decade or more..
