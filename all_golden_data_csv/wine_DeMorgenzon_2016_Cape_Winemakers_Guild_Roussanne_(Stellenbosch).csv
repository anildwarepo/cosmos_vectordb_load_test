country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Carl van der Merwe. This is Winemaker Carl van der Merwe's first CWG auction wine (along with his Gravitas red blend), and it is a stunner right out of the gate. The nose opens with fresh yet ripe notes of waxy melon and peach, kissed by hints of dried fynbos and lightly toasted oak. The medium-weight palate is similarly concentrated and well balanced, with ample acidity and a subtle tannic texture that adds length to the long, evolving finish. While it's certainly delicious now, this will age well through 2023..
