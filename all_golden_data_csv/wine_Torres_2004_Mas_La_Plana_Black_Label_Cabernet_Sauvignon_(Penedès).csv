country: Spain.
description: The color and weight on this Spanish Cabernet are just right. After that, it becomes an insider's wine. Why do we say that? Because it's not like a Napa, Washington or Chilean Cabernet that oozes cassis, plum and sweet French oak. Instead, it shows the terroir of the Mas La Plana vineyard in northeast Spain, and with airing (decanting even better) it becomes a sexy, interesting, Old World Cabernet that delivers provoking, earthier flavors. And it should age well for another decade..
