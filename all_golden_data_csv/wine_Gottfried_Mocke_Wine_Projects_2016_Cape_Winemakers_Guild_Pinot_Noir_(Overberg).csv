country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Gottfried Mocke. Spiced fruit cake, pressed carnation, cherry cola and subtle pepper dance on the nose of this layered, complex bottling. The lush, ripe fruit tones carry through to the medium-weight palate, which offers a crushed satin texture thanks to structured yet subtle tannins and ample acidity. There's a mocha decadence to the finish, but it's pleasant and enticing. Drink nowâ€“2021..
