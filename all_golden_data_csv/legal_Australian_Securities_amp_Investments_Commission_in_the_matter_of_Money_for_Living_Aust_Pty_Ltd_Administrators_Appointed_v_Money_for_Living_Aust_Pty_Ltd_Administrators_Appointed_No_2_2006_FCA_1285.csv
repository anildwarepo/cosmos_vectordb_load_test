case_text: some cross-examination occurred in the course of the trial, no issues of credit arose in relation to any witness and, in the main, the relevant sequence of events was documented. The scheme that was introduced and operated by Money for Living was described by Finkelstein J in Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission, in the matter of Money for Living (Aust) Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) v Money for Living (Aust) Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) (No 2) [2006] FCA 1285 , and I adopt that description which accords with the evidence before me.

The nature of the interests claimed and the manner of their acquisition arise from the following circumstances in relation to the Smith claim and property: 24 May 1984 Estell Sylvia Smith and William Kenneth Smith (who later passed away on 31 March 2004) registered as sole proprietors.

[a]s the grantee, and by virtue, of an option to purchase the land pursuant to an undated Deed of Agreement between Estell Sylvia Smith and MFL Property Holdings Pty Ltd.' Secondly, the question of the operation of s 42(2)(e) of the TLA has been considered previously in the context of the Money for Living scheme in Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission, in the matter of Money for Living (Aust) Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) v Money for Living (Aust) Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) (No 2) [2006] FCA 1285 , where Finkelstein J made the following comments (at [24] [25]): I base this conclusion on s 42(2)(e) of the Transfer of Land Act 1958 (Vic) and the equivalent provision in the Torrens legislation in other States. The effect of s 42(2)(e) is that the estate of a registered proprietor of land (including the proprietor of a mortgage) is subject to the rights of a tenant in possession. In this area the relevant principles are clearly established. The first is that the possession of a tenant is notice of any right of the tenant affecting the land: McMahon v Swan [1924] VLR 397 , 406. The second is that, as Dixon J confirmed in Burke v Dawes (1938) 59 CLR 1, 17-18, s 72 of the Transfer of Land Act 1928 (Vic) (which is the forerunner of s 42) was not intended to apply merely to a tenancy as commonly understood. See also Downie v Lockwood [1965] VR 257 , 259 where Smith J said ""As appears from the cases the exception in s. 42 (2) (e) is to be widely construed; and it is to be treated as producing the result that ""any person in actual occupation of the land obtains as against any inconsistent registered dealing protection and priority for any equitable interest to which his occupation is incident, provided that at law his occupation is referable to a tenancy of sort, whether at will or for years"". Thus, for the purposes of the section a purchaser under a contract, who is given possession by the vendor and is only a tenant at will, is protected in respect of his equitable ownership: Robertson v Keith (1870) 1 VLR(E) 11. So, too, is a vendor who remains in possession until the purchase price is paid: he is a tenant ""whatever might be the legal denomination of the tenancy"": The Commercial Bank of Australia Limited v McCaskill (1897) 23 VLR 10 , 12. It has also been held that an equitable life estate will prevail over a subsequent registered interest: Black v Poole (1895) 16 ALT 155. These principles will protect the tenancies granted to the clients (who it must be assumed were always in possession of their homes) over subsequent dealings with the land. Put another way, the clients' life tenancies are secure, that is their tenancies are ""guaranteed"" to survive any adverse claims made by subsequent registered proprietors and mortgagees, provided they (the clients) continue to pay $1.00 per annum by way of rent and do not vacate their home. Finkelstein J focused upon the TLA. In my view, his Honour's analysis of the relevant principles of law and their application to the TLA was correct, although in light of submissions made by Perpetual, I will need to return to those principles and their application in this proceeding. I will also need to consider the terms of the LTA. The relevant wording of the LTA is materially different from the TLA and, in relation to the circumstances of Easterbrook and Gray, the question arises as to whether they have the interest of a tenant within the meaning of s 40(3)(d)(iii) or (iv) of the LTA. An issue arose as to whether any of the arrangements created a valid tenancy at all, because they were, it was argued by Perpetual, effectively void for uncertainty of duration. The focus of the parties was upon the tenancies being for life which, Perpetual submitted, created the fatal uncertainty..
