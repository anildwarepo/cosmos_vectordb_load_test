country: Italy.
description: Fragrant blue flower, dark spice, crushed herb and wild berry aromas are front and center on this impressive, structured red. The lively, energetic palate offers cranberry, red cherry, licorice and ground clove flavors set against youthful, noble tannins and firm acidity. A tobacco note lingers on the finish. It's still young and tightly wound but will blossom into a beauty over the next decade. Drink 2023–2045..
