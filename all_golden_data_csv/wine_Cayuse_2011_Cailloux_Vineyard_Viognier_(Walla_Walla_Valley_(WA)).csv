country: US.
description: This vintage marks a welcome return of Viognier to the otherwise all-red Cayuse portfolio. It's an immaculate, elegant, complex wine, redolent of wet stone, dried herbs (thyme, rosemary), jicama, cucumber, lime, grapefruit, melon and more. It is clear and clean, precise and focused. It does not push the ripeness, or overshoot the cool vintage, and never sacrifices complexity. Fermented and aged in a concrete egg, it's seen no oak at all..
