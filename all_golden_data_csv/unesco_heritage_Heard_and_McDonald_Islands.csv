unesco_heritage_Heard_and_McDonald_Islands,"Name: Heard and McDonald Islands.
short_description: <p>Heard Island and McDonald Islands are located in the Southern Ocean, approximately 1,700 km from the Antarctic continent and 4,100 km south-west of Perth. As the only volcanically active subantarctic islands they &lsquo;open a window into the earth&rsquo;, thus providing the opportunity to observe ongoing geomorphic processes and glacial dynamics. The distinctive conservation value of Heard and McDonald &ndash; one of the world&rsquo;s rare pristine island ecosystems &ndash; lies in the complete absence of alien plants and animals, as well as human impact.</p>.
