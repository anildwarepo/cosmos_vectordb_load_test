country: US.
description: Greg Brewer resurrects his briefly shuttered brand to show what can be done on the floral edge of Chardonnay. This bottling that is very light in the glass offers tons of boisterous fruit displayed with delicacy, including tuberose, orange blossoms, lime and ripe pears. Guava powers the sip along with coconut, mango and apple-blossom flavors, wrapped in a tantalizing acidity. It would go great with sushi..
