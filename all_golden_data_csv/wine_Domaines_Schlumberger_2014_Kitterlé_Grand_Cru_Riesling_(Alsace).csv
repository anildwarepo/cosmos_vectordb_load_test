country: France.
description: The nose is a little shy, just hinting at citrus freshness. The very dry palate brings all the freshness to the fore—this is lithe and vividly lemony. Exquisite tartness tingles deliciously on the tongue and ripples its vivid rays of shimmering bright light across the senses—what a picture of 2014. If you like it emollient and rounded this is not for you. This is for lovers of bright uncompromising purity and freshness. This has real verve, bags of it, all backed up with serious lemon fruit. Gorgeously refreshing now but it will be even better with time. Drink 2017–2037..
