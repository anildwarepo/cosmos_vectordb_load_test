First Page Reviews: installed only to find exhibitions listed are from 2018. out of date. no current exhibits listed. Not a helpful app Expected to see a preview of the exibition. No. Some local music only to accompany  your tour. No guided information on the pictures. Then a page showing a keypad. Chose a stop number. What does that mean? VAG, why even bother..
