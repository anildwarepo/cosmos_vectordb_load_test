title: The Earthen Pot and the Iron Pot.
text: An iron pot proposedTo an earthen pot a journey.The latter was opposed,Expressing the concern heHad felt about the dangerOf going out a ranger.He thought the kitchen hearthThe safest place on earthFor one so very brittle.“For thee, who art a kettle,And hast a tougher skin,There’s nought to keep thee in.”“I’ll be thy body-guard,”Replied the iron pot;“If anything that’s hardShould threaten thee a jot,Between you I will go,And save thee from the blow.”This offer him persuaded.The iron pot paradedHimself as guard and guideClose at his cousin’s side.Now, in their tripod way,They hobble as they may;And eke together boltAt every little jolt,—Which gives the crockery pain;But presently his comrade hitsSo hard, he dashes him to bits,Before he can complain.Take care that you associateWith equals only, lest your fateBetween these pots should find its mate..
