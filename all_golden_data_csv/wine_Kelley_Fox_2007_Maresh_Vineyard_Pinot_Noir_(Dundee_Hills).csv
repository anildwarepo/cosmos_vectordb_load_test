country: US.
description: This has a surprising amount of vanilla cream in the flavors, plus soft, seductive raspberry fruit. The fruit comes from the oldest part of the Maresh vineyard—38-year-old self-rooted vines. The wine is a pale rose, yet substantial in the style of a classic Pinot from Eyrie. After some hours breathing it opens up with elegant, seductive aromas and some caramel streaks, delicate and perfectly proportioned..
