country: US.
description: This isn't Mondavi's most expensive Fumé (Sauvignon) Blanc. But it is one of their best ever. In fact, it's so classic, you could use it in a winemaking class to teach future vintners about how great Napa Sauvignon Blanc should taste. It's bone dry, brilliantly crisp with acidity and gently touched by oak. The main notes are of lees, which give a sourdough tang, and layers of lemons, limes, pink grapefruits, gooseberries and rich tropical fruits. An unbelievable value at this price, but only 1,975 cases were produced..
