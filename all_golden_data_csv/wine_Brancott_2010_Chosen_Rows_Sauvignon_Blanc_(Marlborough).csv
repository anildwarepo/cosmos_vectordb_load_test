country: New Zealand.
description: It's taken New Zealand's largest producer a while to get on board the barrel-fermented express, and this wine is still only 50% done in wood, mainly large formats. Some funky, slightly acrid notes mark the nose, but this adds welcome complexity to the stone-fruit aromas. It's rich and textural in the mouth, the ripe fruit marked by intriguing hints of green herbs and spice before drawing to a long, elegant finish..
