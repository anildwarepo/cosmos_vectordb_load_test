country: US.
description: Extraordinarily rich and ripe, this unique Cabernet-based blend contains 30% Syrah. It's a dramatic wine, marked by a near-perfect tannin structure and massive, long-lasting flavors of blackberries, black currants, chocolate, licorice, candied violets, sweet leather, peppery spices and smoky sandalwood. Marked by youthful primary fruit now, it needs time to knit together. Give it until after 2012 to come around, and should develop for many years after..
