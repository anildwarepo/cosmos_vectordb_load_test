description: A blend of 26% Roussanne, 25% Chardonnay, 19% Grenache Blanc, 17% Chenin Blanc and 13% Viognier, this is a complex and layered wine. A soft flinty character lies atop a rich bouquet of yellow apple, ripe green melon, tangerine and honeycomb. The medium-weight palate offers both weight and refinement, with a smooth texture and ripe fruit flavors that are cut by ample acidity and lingering sweet-spice accents. Drink nowâ€“2019..
