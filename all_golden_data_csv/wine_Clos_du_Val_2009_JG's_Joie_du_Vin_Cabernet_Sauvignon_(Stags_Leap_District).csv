country: US.
description: This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon was aged for 26 months in 50% new French oak. The mouthfeel is soft and luxurious. This wine was bottled only in magnums, and it's gorgeous and delicious, with classic blackberry, cherry, currant and dark chocolate flavors. Despite its full body, the wine has an elegant silkiness that's light and feathery. This is clearly the greatest Cabernet Clos du Val has ever produced. Drink nowâ€“2026..
