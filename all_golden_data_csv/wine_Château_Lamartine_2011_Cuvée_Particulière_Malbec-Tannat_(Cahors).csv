description: Full of both fruit and structure, this richly perfumed and spicy wine is impressive with solid tannins that are coming into balance with the rich black fruits. It still needs aging, so drink from 2018. The property is owned by a dedicated wine family that over the years tended the few remaining Malbec vines that survived phylloxera of late 1800s, were founders of the union to protect Cahors wines in the 1930s and helped revive the Confrérie des vins de Cahors. Alain Gayraud is the family's current owner..
