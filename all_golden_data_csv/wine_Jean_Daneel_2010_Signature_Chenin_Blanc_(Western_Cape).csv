country: South Africa.
description: This oaked Chenin shows great structure and power now, with the potential to cellar nicely for another three years or beyond. Toasted brioche, wood-grilled peaches and quince aromas open up immediately on the bouquet and carry through to the palate alongside seductive accents of sweet spice, almond skin and orange oil. The texture is round and full, and the spice-driven finish is long and satisfying..
