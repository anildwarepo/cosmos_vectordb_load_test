country: Italy.
description: Dark berry, rose petal, tilled soil, aromatic herb, leather and a whiff of game are just some of the aromas you'll find on this intense, full-bodied wine. The palate is still tight, showing wild cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice, baking spice and tobacco alongside firm tannins that need time to unwind. It already has depth but will develop even more complexity over the next decade and more. Drink 2018–2027..
