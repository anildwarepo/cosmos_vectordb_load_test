Description: As the summer of his eighteenth birthday unfolds, Sam Nesbitt finalizes plans to escape his violent abusive father and bleak Jersey Shore town. Although the local police have Sam in their sights for a break-in and theft, he has nimbly avoided arrest, and vows to stay out of trouble. His plans are disrupted when he meets Julie, a pretty, vivacious young woman from the city, who takes an unexpected interest in him. To cement her interest, he tells numerous lies about himself, including his acceptance by an Ivy League college. Sam, who has survived by suppressing his feelings and emotions--playing it cool--obsessively pursues her, setting aside his habitual caution, altering his escape plans, and experiencing his first romantic love and sexual experience, pain and joy in tow..
