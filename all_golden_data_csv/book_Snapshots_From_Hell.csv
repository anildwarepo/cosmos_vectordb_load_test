Description: This work is an attempt to provide an answer to the paramount question every prospective student asks, ""What is business school really like?"" During his first year at Stanford Business School, the author began keeping a journal of his day-to-day impressions which evolved into this book, the writing of which he came to see as a ""simple act of decency, like going back to the last calm bend in the river and nailing up a sign that reads 'Waterfall Ahead'"". From his initial harrowing days at ""maths camp"" through the dizzying phalanx of core courses, the frenzy of the exam week, the pitfalls and triumphs of the interview process (including a surreal interview with Robert Maxwell) to being wined and dined by some of the most prestigious companies in the world, Robinson's account is an irreverent story peopled with a wide range of characters..
