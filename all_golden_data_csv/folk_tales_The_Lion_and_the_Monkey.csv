title: The Lion and the Monkey.
text: The lion, for his kingdom’s sake,In morals would some lessons take,And therefore call’d, one summer’s day,The monkey, master of the arts,An animal of brilliant parts,To hear what he could say.“Great king,” the monkey thus began,“To reign upon the wisest planRequires a prince to set his zeal,And passion for the public weal,Distinctly and quite high aboveA certain feeling call’d self-love,The parent of all vices,In creatures of all sizes.To will this feeling from one’s breast away,Is not the easy labour of a day;By that your majesty august,Will execute your royal trust,From folly free and aught unjust.”“Give me,” replied the king,“Example of each thing.”“Each species,” said the sage,—“And I begin with ours,—Exalts its own peculiar powersAbove sound reason’s gauge.Meanwhile, all other kinds and tribesAs fools and blockheads it describes,With other compliments as cheap.But, on the other hand, the sameSelf-love inspires a beast to heapThe highest pyramid of fameFor every one that bears his name;Because he justly deems such praiseThe easiest way himself to raise.‘Tis my conclusion in the case,That many a talent here belowIs but cabal, or sheer grimace,—The art of seeming things to know—An art in which perfection liesMore with the ignorant than wise.”.
