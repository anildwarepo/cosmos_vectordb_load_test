Description: First published in 1962 and long unavailable, BEYOND THE CHAINS OF ILLUSION is, only at first glance, a book about Marx and Freud--those two intellectual giants of the 20th century. Fromm here shows himself an outstanding interpreter of Marx. In all, Fromm's re-creation of the Freudian and Marxist way of thinking is, essentially, a look at the individual and society. BEYOND THE CHAINS OF ILLUSION will introduce many of today's readers to unknown aspects of Marx and Freud, as it also serves as a unique introduction to the life and mind of Erich Fromm as well. A new foreword by Fromm Literary Executor Rainer Funk puts this book into historic context and high relief..
