title: The Shepherd and His Dog.
text: A shepherd, with a single dog,Was ask’d the reason whyHe kept a dog, whose least supplyAmounted to a loaf of breadFor every day. The people saidHe’d better give the animalTo guard the village seignior’s hall;For him, a shepherd, it would beA thriftier economyTo keep small curs, say two or three,That would not cost him half the food,And yet for watching be as good.The fools, perhaps, forgot to tellIf they would fight the wolf as well.The silly shepherd, giving heed,Cast off his dog of mastiff breed,And took three dogs to watch his cattle,Which ate far less, but fled in battle.Not vain our tale, if it convincesSmall states that ’tis a wiser thingTo trust a single powerful king,Than half a dozen petty princes..
