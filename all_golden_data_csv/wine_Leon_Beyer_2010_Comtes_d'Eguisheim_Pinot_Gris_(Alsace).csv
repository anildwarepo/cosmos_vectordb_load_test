country: France.
description: Lifted ethereal notes of bitter almond and peach kernel alongside hints of chamomile announce evolution and development. Underneath these aromatic forces on the nose, the palate reveals ripe peach and pear on a very concentrated, absolutely streamlined and bone-dry body. Pleasantly bitter pith notes give a grown-up edge to this mature marvel. Wonderfully layered flavors make you linger and show what time can do to a classy Pinot Gris..
