country: Germany.
description: Hazy layers of smoke and struck flint permeate amidst pristine gooseberry and white grapefruit in this late release bottling, lending an early glimpse into its development. It's a complex dry Riesling mingling elements of earth, fruit and flower into a silken tonic catapulted by jolts of zest and acidity. Lithe and lean, it finishes with a long, mineral repose. Alluring already but should drink well through 2030 at least..
