wine_Mascarello_Giuseppe_e_Figlio_2010_Monprivato__(Barolo),"Unnamed: 0: 45573.
country: Italy.
description: Elegant and complex, this gorgeous wine is all about finesse, offering enticing aromas of rose petal, iris, perfumed berry, baking spices, anise and chopped aromatic herbs. The structured but silky palate seamlessly melds together juicy Morello cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, clove, licorice and tobacco while bright acidity and ultrafine tannins provide the framework. It's already tempting and impeccably balanced but will be even better in a few years. Drink 2018–2030..
