country: South Africa.
description: Here's an intense and brooding Shiraz with fantastic depth and character. Aromas of whole bacon slab, kirsch, black berry and cigar tobacco prime the palate for the full flavor experience. The creamy mouthfeel is loaded with black fruit flavors integrated with sweet woody spice throughout. The finish is long and the impression strong. Pair with an equally flavorful dish to avoid the wine being overwhelming..
