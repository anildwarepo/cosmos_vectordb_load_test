wine_Raats_Family_2010_Cabernet_Franc_(Stellenbosch),"Unnamed: 0: 105421.
country: South Africa.
description: Pure and focused, Bruwer Raats's love of and attention to Cabernet Franc results in a wine that always impresses, and is a bit of an anomaly in the South African wine world. Bright notes of red cherry and currant unfold on the nose and mouth, with accents of ashy tobacco, foliage, pepper and just the faintest suggestion of vanilla bean. Medium weight, with dry, dusty tannins that lend grip to the finish..
