wine_Sokol_Blosser_NV_Evolution_Lucky_No._9_White_(America),"Unnamed: 0: 4341.
country: US.
description: This nonvintage blend is best identified by its edtion number—this latest being #20. It's a runaway success, cleverly incorporating up to eight different varieties. Mixing aromatic whites and fruit-powered grapes such as Chardonnay and Pinot Gris, it captures the best of both. Here the citrusy aromatics are principally from Muscat, while a touch of Sémillon adds a lick of lanolin to the tangy, juicy fruit..
