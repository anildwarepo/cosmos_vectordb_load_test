country: US.
description: The estate vineyard is in the Vaca Mountains, east of the city of Napa. You can taste the cool climate in the brisk acidity that frames this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. It's very ripe in blackberries, with rich layers of toast from new French oak. For all the sweet fruit, the finish is dry, even rasping. Such are the tannins that the wine feels tough, even at this age. Give it another five years, at least..
