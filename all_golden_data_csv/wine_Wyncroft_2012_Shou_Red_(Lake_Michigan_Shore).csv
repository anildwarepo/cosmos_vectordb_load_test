country: US.
description: Hailing from a single vineyard in Michigan's southern AVA, this is a Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant blend (77%), with Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petite Verdot making up the difference. This has cooked-down bramble berry aromas on the nose, and also brings to mind twings and stems. The medium-bodied palate shows a bit more character, with juicy black berry and red currant flavors elevated over green peppercorn and medium-grained tannins..
