wine_Aril_2010_Syrah_(Atlas_Peak),"Unnamed: 0: 34664.
country: US.
description: The grapes for this wine are grown at 1,500-foot elevation, from a site that provides more coolness than the appellation's valley floor, a data point that becomes relevant to the taste and aroma of this wine. Spice, leather and garrigue combine for a seamless, soft and ageable experience, the wine dark and brooding in blackberry and bacon, yet beautifully aromatic in fresh violet and lavender. Enjoy through 2020..
