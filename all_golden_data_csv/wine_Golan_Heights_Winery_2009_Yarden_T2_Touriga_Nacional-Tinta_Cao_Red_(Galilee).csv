country: Israel.
description: If blackberry preserves and black licorice were made into a wine, this would be it. While Yarden's T2 dry blend of Touriga Nacional and Tinta Cao is a very good wine, this sweet Port-style wine misses the mark. With a nose of blackberry preserves, cassis and rose petal—and flavors of blackberry, cassis, licorice and clove—it should be gorgeous in the mouth. However, the overall sweetness is cloying without necessary balance..
