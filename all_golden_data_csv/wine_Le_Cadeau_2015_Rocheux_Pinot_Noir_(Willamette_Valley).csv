country: US.
description: The name refers to the rocks in this section of the estate vineyard, and they can be felt as well as tasted in the wine. The mouthfeel is slightly astringent, with hints of metal and stone, and the alcohol is muted, allowing the more subtle suggestions of citrus and beet and truffle and wild strawberry to emerge. All in all it's the most complex and intriguing of the winery's offerings, and merits your full attention..
