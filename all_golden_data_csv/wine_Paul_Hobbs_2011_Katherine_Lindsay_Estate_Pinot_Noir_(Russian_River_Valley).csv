country: US.
description: This bottling by Hobbs typically is a compelling Pinot Noir, but with the 2011 vintage, they've exceeded even the outstanding 2010. The wine is extraordinarily delicate in the mouth, with a cloud-like airiness that's like pure silk. Yet there are powerful raspberry, cherry, herb, cassis, mushroom and sandalwood flavors that are a delight to experience. The wine has none of the unripe vegetal notes that mar so many other 2011 Pinot Noirs. Drink this gorgeous wine now and over the next 10 years..
