country: US.
description: Designed by Delicato winemaker James Ewart as a Pinot with power that can handle a steak, this wine features a dense, dark nose, with blackberry, olallieberry and red currant cut by allspice, clove and licorice-vanilla cookies. The palate is rich and luxurious, with ripe cranberry and red-cherry elements spiced up with mocha, cappuccino and long-lingering vanilla bean. It's boisterous and fresh, so drink now with a juicy rib-eye..
