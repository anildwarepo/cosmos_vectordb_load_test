country: US.
description: This vineyard is best known for its Syrah but Grenache also shines, as evidenced by this compelling bottle. The aromas pop with complex notes of flowers, brown stems, mineral, smoke, raspberries, peppery spice and the vineyard's signature earthy funk. The palate shows delicacy, precision and detail, with a lightly meaty, peppery finish that lingers. It's a completely captivating expression of the variety with balance that downright dazzles..
