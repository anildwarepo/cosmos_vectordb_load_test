country: US.
description: Planted in 1993, this four-acre, cool-climate vineyard had a relatively late harvest in 2005, which can, in the Pacific Northwest, result in more European, vertically structured wines. This is wrapped up tight, and is far away from the sweet, succulent fruit of California Pinot Noir, but its pleasures are many and varied. Clear and bright, its berry-cherry fruit is shaded with leaf and earth. The tannins are firm but quite polished, and the flavors meld together seamlessly..
