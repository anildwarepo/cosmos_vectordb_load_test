country: US.
description: Petit Barone changes the blend signficantly from vintage to vintage. Here it's a Bordeaux-style mix of 49% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Merlot, 17% Cab Franc and 2% Petit Verdot, aged two years in half new French and American barrels. The oak comes through with strong flavors of licorice, espresso and char, along with some fairly stiff, chalky tannins. But there is generous fruit—black cherry and cassis—and the wine delivers a lot of big, powerful flavor for the modest tariff..
