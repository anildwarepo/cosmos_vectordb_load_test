country: US.
description: This is certainly one of Testarossa's best 2011 Pinot Noirs. The winery purchases most of its fruit, but in this case, the vineyard is co-owned by Testarossa, and winemaker Bill Brosseau had complete control in the vineyard. The wine is gorgeous, complex and ageable. Beyond the exquisite raspberry and blueberry fruit is a mineral-derived savoriness that makes it firm in the mouth. Gorgeous now, this single-vineyard wine should age well for at least 12 years..
