description: Almost black in color, this prestige 100% Malbec cuv√©e is as intense as it is powerful. Dark and brooding, still very young, it shows its wood aging strongly. As it ages, this richness will mellow well to give a concentrated while stylish wine. This small-production wine is named after a statue of Notre Dame in the vineyards of this family estate taken over by daughter Martine and husband Serge Costes 20 years ago. Drink from 2019..
