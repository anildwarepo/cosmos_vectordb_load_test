country: US.
description: This joins the happily increasing ranks of Oregon Pinots under $20 that can successfully compete with entry-level bottles from New Zealand, California and Burgundy. Grounded in varietal character, it brings tart red fruits, berries, cherries and loamy earth into play; the acids are plentiful and the wine does not overreach. Flavors are true and lingering, with suggestions of gunmetal and iron ore adding interest to the finish..
