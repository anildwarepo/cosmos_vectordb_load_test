country: Portugal.
description: This is the latest release of what has long been regarded as Portugal's iconic wine. And it is magnificent. The last vintage was the 2004 and the wait has now shown to be worthwhile. With its immense span and breadth of flavors and rich structure it is a superb manifestation of the great vineyards of the Douro Superior. Big bold fruits and acidity are matched by the tannins and concentration. Hold this for many years or at least wait until 2022..
