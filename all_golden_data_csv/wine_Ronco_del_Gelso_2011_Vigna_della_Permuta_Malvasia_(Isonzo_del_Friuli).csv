country: Italy.
description: Malvasia is widely planted across Italy with clones that vary in aromatic intensity. Despite the grape's deeply historic roots in this country, it is rare to find it vinified in the manner of this vineyard-designate expression. The wine opens with a deep golden color and bright aromas of exotic fruit, pineapple and sweet summer peach. The mouthfeel is rich and soft with just a playful dab of sweetness that would pair with country pâté..
