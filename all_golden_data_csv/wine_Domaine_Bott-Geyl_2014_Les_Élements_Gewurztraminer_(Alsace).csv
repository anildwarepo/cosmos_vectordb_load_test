description: Peach and honey characterize the nose on this golden wine. These flavors also play generously on the concentrated rich midpalate where they are countered by aromatic orange and tangerine zestiness, creating a lovely contrast and exciting richness. There is just a touch of residual sweetness here to create some drama, but it works to great effect. The wine is not sweet enough for deserts but will work with Asian spices or ripe cheeses. It's simply wonderful and so balanced..
