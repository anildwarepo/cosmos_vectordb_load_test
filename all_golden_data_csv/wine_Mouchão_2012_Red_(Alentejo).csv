wine_Mouchão_2012_Red_(Alentejo),"Unnamed: 0: 45990.
country: Portugal.
description: The estate wine from Mouchão is always a great wine. This latest release, almost black in color and five-years-old, is hugely rich, powered by black fruits and juicy acidity. Made principally from Alicante Bouschet, it shows the power and the aging potential of this variety in the Alentejo. This wine, foot-trodden in open stone lagars, is destined for much longer aging. Drink at the earliest in 2021..
