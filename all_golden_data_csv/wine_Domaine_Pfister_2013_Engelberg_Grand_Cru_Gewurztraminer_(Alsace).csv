country: France.
description: The yellow-fruited richness of mirabelle compote with a touch of vanilla becomes apparent on the nose. The palate is just as luscious as promised but also carries a welcome, thrilling streak of lemon oil at its core, brightening and framing the medium-sweetness with its zesty lift. A touch of pleasant phenolic bitterness can just about be felt, adding dimension to the palate. This is intriguing and exciting in the way it plays with richness and sweetness while keeping them on a very tight rein. Lovely. Drink 2017–2027..
