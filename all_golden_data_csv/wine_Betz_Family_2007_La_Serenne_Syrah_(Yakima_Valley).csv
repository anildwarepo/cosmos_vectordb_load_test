country: US.
description: This is 100% Syrah from the Boushey vineyard. It's so compact that it's almost impenetrable, but the gorgeous aromas portend a glorious wine given appropriate bottle age and/or breathing time. A dark, dusty mix of black fruits, black olives, black coffee and licorice, this has such density that it's almost impossible to separate out all the fruit layers, let alone the earthier components that make it so distinctive. At 14.8% alcohol, this may be the biggest Betz Boushey Syrah ever..
