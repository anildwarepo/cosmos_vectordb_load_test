country: South Africa.
description: A beautifully balanced and nuanced wine. The aromas are heady and thick but still vibrant, displaying juicy notes of black cherry, black raspberry sauce and semidried fig laced with accents of bittersweet chocolate, tobacco and white pepper. The texture is like crushed satin, with well-integrated tannins and a creamy mouthfeel. Touches of licorice root and smoky cedar spice augment the dark fruit on the lengthy finish. Drink now–2014..
