country: US.
description: The Ulysses red has been the main calling card for this winery, and it is a distinctive wine that expresses the complexity—with no herbs barred—of Yakima Valley grapes. Woven into the heart of the wine are threads of herb, olive, pea vine and other green notes, but there are also black cherry and cassis flavors. It's balanced and proportionate, closer to a true Bordeaux-style blend than most Washington efforts..
