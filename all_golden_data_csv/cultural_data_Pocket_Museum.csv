Application Description: Get to know the extraordinary collections of the Museums of Siena in a new and fun way: try this free app that will accompany you on your discovery of the museum collections and their provenance. The texts in the app include many exclusive contents – photo galleries, videos and original graphic reconstructions – that once downloaded can be visualised even when not on internet. All content can be shared and saved in your favourite list; the app also includes each museum’s plan to help you organize your visit, as well as interactive maps to guide you on the discovery of the territory, with all its palazzi, churches and archaeological sites. Furthermore, thanks to the state of the art technologies applied to cultural heritage, the use of beacons will enable additional multimedia contents inside the museums. The Museum in Your Pocket project is part of the “Musei Accreditati Regione Toscana 2013” call, and its purpose is to make museums accessible to a variety of audiences, also inviting the digital native generations to become familiar with cultural heritage.Read moreCollapse.
