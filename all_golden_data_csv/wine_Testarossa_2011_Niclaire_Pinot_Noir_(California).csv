wine_Testarossa_2011_Niclaire_Pinot_Noir_(California),"Unnamed: 0: 98412.
country: US.
description: Made from selected lots of Testarossa's various vineyards up and down the state, hence the California appellation, this is also the winery's most expensive Pinot Noir. Right now, it's not showing terribly well. There's something closed and stubborn about it. Partly that's the tannins and acidity, but mostly it may be because these scattered lots simply haven't come together yet to make nice. Give it 3â€“4 years..
designation: Niclaire.
points: 92.
price: 79.0.
