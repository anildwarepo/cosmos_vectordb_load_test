country: Austria.
description: This is still very tightly coiled: the nose says little and the palate holds on tight to its beautifully pure blueberry fruit. There is lip-smacking freshness and a very finely woven tannin structure but this impressive wine does need time to come into itself and relax its fruit. There is something profound and stony about this, something mysterious, brooding and wild. Cellar this and then rejoice. Drink 2020–2035..
