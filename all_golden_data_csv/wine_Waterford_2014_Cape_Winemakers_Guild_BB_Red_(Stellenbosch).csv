country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Kevin Arnold. A Bordeaux-style blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Cabernet Franc and 7% Petit Verdot, this is quite toasty and spicy upfront, with pronounced notes of baked mulberry, boysenberry and cassis that are dusted by earthy, rooty tree bark and woodspice. More ripe fruit flavors, medium-plus tannins and ample acidity result in a crushed-satin texture, finishing long and dry. Drink nowâ€“2024..
