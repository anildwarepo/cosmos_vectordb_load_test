country: US.
description: This is the winery's top Chardonnay, kept in bottle an extra year prior to release. Even in a challenging vintage such as 2011 it's a huge wine with astonishing concentration and power. The fruit has coiled intensity—so potent that it seems ready to burst wide open. Ripe apple and peach, olive oil, toasted almonds and plenty of new oak flavors abound. It's a jaw-dropper, and may be drunk now through 2022..
