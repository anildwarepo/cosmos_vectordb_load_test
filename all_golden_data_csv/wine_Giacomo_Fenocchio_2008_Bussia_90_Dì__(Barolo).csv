description: This superb single-vineyard bottling from the heart of Bussia was macerated on the skins for a whopping 90 days. It's a breathtaking expression of Barolo, with intense Nebbiolo scents of rose, truffle and leather. The palate shows vibrant black cherry, truffle, spice, carob, pastry cream and balsamic herb notes and has remarkable depth and complexity. This is already fantastic and will age well for decades.
