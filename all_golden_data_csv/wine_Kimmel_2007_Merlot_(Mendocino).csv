wine_Kimmel_2007_Merlot_(Mendocino),"Unnamed: 0: 100391.
country: US.
description: A terrific red wine. Stood out in a blind tasting among expensive Napa Valley Bordeaux-style reds. The grapes are from the winery's high-elevation ranch in Potter Valley. The wine shows firm tannins and a brisk backbone of acidity, with the cherry, red plum and currant flavors grounded with fresh herbs, mushrooms, grilled meat and a smack of tamari that suggests Chinese mushu pork. Really a dramatic wine that should hold over the next four years..
