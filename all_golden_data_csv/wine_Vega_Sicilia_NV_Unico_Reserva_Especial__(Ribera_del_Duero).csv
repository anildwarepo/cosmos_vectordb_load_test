wine_Vega_Sicilia_NV_Unico_Reserva_Especial__(Ribera_del_Duero),"Unnamed: 0: 97421.
country: Spain.
description: This blend of the 1996, '98 and '02 vintages is mature and browning in hue. The nose is superripe, with prune, brandied cherry, tobacco and molasses notes. A soft, creamy palate holds vanilla, tobacco, baking spice, prune and raisin flavors, while the finish is an echo of what came before. Excellent when judged in its own right, this doesn't quite compare with Vega's best wines. Drink through 2025..
