Description: At the Nuremberg rallies, when Hitler roared through the streets elebrating his newly-won domination of Germany, Shirer was there. In Munich, as Chamberlain abandoned the Czechs, Shirer was there. In Vienna during the night of the Anschluss, in Berlin, when Hitler loosed his Blitzkrieg on Poland and began the war, Shirer was there. Through articles, translations of Hitler's speeches, and his own broadcasts, Shirer tried to warn the Western world of the terrible evil that was arising in Germany. The Nightmare Years is his witness to these years in which a collective madness gripped the German soul as it lurched towards war and Armageddon..
