country: France.
description: A subtle hint of sandalwood and rose plays alongside the juicy pear of the palate. There is a rich floral creaminess on the palate that flashes a touch of vanilla and hints of Damask rose. A pleasantly bitter phenolic edge gives direction to the dynamic energy of fruit that trembles at the core of this wine. Hints of rose, lemon oil and peach linger long after the last sip. This is concentrated, off dry and energetic. Drink 2017–2027..
