wine_Giaconda_2008_Warner_Vineyard_Shiraz_(Victoria),"Unnamed: 0: 87623.
country: Australia.
description: With only 10 cases imported to the U.S., one suspects that this terrific wine will largely be found in exclusive restaurants. If you can find a bottle at a reasonable markup, jump on it, for this is one of Victoria's finest Shirazes. Hickory smoke, espresso and herbal notes accent raspberry fruit, whose brightness gives the wine extra lift and dimension. It's creamy and lushly textured without ever seeming heavy, and boasts a long, silky finish that echoes with suggestions of cocoa powder and pulverized coffee beans. Drink nowâ€“2025..
