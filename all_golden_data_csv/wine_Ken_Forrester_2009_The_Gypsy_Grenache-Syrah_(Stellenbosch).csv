country: South Africa.
description: The 2009 Gypsy, unlike the 2008, includes no Mourv√®dre in the blend, meaning it's just Grenache and Syrah, at about half each. This is a powerful and intense wine, with forward aromas and flavors of cherry, black plum and boysenberry that are spiced with notes of crushed purple florals, black pepper and licorice. With medium-plus tannins, bold flavors, a firm texture and a long finish, this is one that is both drinking well now and should also age nicely through 2016..
