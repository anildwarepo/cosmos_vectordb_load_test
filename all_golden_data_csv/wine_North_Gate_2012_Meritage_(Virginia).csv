country: US.
description: About half Merlot, with Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc making up the difference, this wine brings concentrated red cherry and currant notes to a mix of sawdust and anise on the nose. The full-bodied palate follows suit, with additional notes of dark plum adding depth. Grippy tannins balanced by driving acidity make this wine a well-balanced showing from an environmentally-conscious, LEED Gold-certified winery..
