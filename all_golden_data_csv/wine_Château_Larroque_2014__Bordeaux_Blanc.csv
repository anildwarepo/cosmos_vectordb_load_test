country: France.
description: This perfumed wine discloses hints of apricots and white peaches as well as ripe lime juice. It is balanced, fruity with a good touch of minerality to give texture. The aftertaste is all about fresh fruits that will soften over the next few months. Produced by the Ducourt family, first in Bordeaux in 1858 and now one of the largest independent producers in the region. Philippe Ducourt handles the vineyards and Jérémy Ducourt makes this wine..
