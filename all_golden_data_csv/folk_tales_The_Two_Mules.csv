title: The Two Mules.
text: Two mules were bearing on their backs,One, oats; the other, silver of the tax.The latter glorying in his load,March’d proudly forward on the road;And, from the jingle of his bell,‘Twas plain he liked his burden well.But in a wild-wood glenA band of robber menRush’d forth upon the twain.Well with the silver pleased,They by the bridle seizedThe treasure mule so vain.Poor mule! in struggling to repelHis ruthless foes, he fellStabb’d through; and with a bitter sighing,He cried, “Is this the lot they promised me?My humble friend from danger free,While, weltering in my gore, I’m dying?”“My friend,” his fellow-mule replied,“It is not well to have one’s work too high.If thou hadst been a miller’s drudge, as I,Thou wouldst not thus have died.”.
