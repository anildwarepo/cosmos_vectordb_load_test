country: US.
description: This is a barrel selection, presumably limited in cases. It's an extraordinarily rich, concentrated 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, made in the modern cult-style of massively extracted blackberries, black currants, cassis liqueur and chocolate, with oak bringing the usual sweet toast and vanilla complexities. This deserves its high score for sheer opulence and great Napa structure. Delicious now, and could easily age for at least 10 years..
