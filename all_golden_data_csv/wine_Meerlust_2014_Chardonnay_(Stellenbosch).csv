description: This wine shows superb balance between ripe fruit tones, attractive oak influence and natural freshness. It leads with scents of lightly toasted nuts, orange cream, freshly dried grass and yellow flowers. The medium-weight palate offers decadent flavors of toasted apple skin and brioche, with orange-flavored acidity that lift's the wine's richness. An evolving finish seals the deal. Drink nowâ€“2020..
