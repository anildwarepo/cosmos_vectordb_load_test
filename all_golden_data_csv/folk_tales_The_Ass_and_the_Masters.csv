title: The Ass and the Masters.
text: A gardener’s ass complain’d to DestinyOf being made to rise before the dawn.“The cocks their matins have not sung,” said he,“Ere I am up and gone.And all for what? To market herbs, it seems.Fine cause, indeed, to interrupt my dreams!”Fate, moved by such a prayer,Sent him a currier’s load to bear,Whose hides so heavy and ill-scented were,They almost choked the foolish beast.“I wish me with my former lord,” he said:“For then, whene’er he turn’d his head,If on the watch, I caughtA cabbage-leaf, which cost me nought.But, in this horrid place, I findNo chance or windfall of the kind;—Or if, indeed, I do,The cruel blows I rue.”Anon it came to passHe was a collier’s ass.Still more complaint. “What now?” said Fate,Quite out of patience.“If on this jackass I must wait,What will become of kings and nations?Has none but he aught here to tease him?Have I no business but to please him?”And Fate had cause;—for all are soUnsatisfied while here below.Our present lot is aye the worst.Our foolish prayers the skies infest.Were Jove to grant all we request,The din renew’d, his head would burst..
