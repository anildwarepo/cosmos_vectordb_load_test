country: US.
description: Established in the early 70s by Ed O'Keefe Jr., this Michigan winery remains in the family to this day and maintains the founding father's focus on producing wines from 100% vinifera grapes in a region where hybrids might be the easier option. Perseverance pays off in this delightfully balanced dry Riesling that seamlessly blends juicy peach, pineapple rind and a vein of talc-dusted citrus. Texturally round and soft, with a peach-fuzz feel, this is a veritable steal for the price..
