Description: For Kahlil Gibran (1883-1931), love was the supreme way of achieving self-realization and completeness as a human being. Such themes as love, passion and marriage dominate the section on love in Gibran's celebrated The Prophet, but they are expressed with equal eloquence in his earlier Arabic stories, parables and prose poems..
