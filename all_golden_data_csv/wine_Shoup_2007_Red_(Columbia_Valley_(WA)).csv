wine_Shoup_2007_Red_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 54267.
country: US.
description: Made by Long Shadows winemaker Gilles Nicault, this wine, along with the 2008 and 2009 vintages, were released together. This is the most mature—a five-grape, Bordeaux-style blend. It's a beautifully integrated, floral and dusty wine, with contoured, sculpted fruit. Plums and cherries dominate, with dustings of cocoa powder, coffee and a hint of hazelnut. The wine is graceful and profound, with superb length and finesse..
