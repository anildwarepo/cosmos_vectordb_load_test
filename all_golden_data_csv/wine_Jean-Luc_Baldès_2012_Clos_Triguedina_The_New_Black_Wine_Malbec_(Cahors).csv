country: France.
description: This wine recreates the medieval technique used to cook the fermenting must to make it more stable. In this case, it also produces a wine that is almost black in color, dark in appearance and in flavor. There is also some elegance here, with fine tannins that are well integrated into the juicy black fruits and ripe character. It's a wine to age, although it is juicy enough to drink now. Best, though, from 2018..
