country: France.
description: There is an aromatic, herbal lift among the full-fruited nose of this wine that is reminiscent of freshly peeled curls of ripe Cox Orange Pippin apples. The palate adds a pleasantly bitter, slightly phenolic edge that gives texture and and counterbalance to the soaring freshness of the citrus and apple notes. Concentration and power come in a compact, taut package that is likely to unfold a little more with bottle age. It finishes with the rich and honest flavor of crisp, ripe apples. Compelling now but it will be even better. Drink 2017–2030..
