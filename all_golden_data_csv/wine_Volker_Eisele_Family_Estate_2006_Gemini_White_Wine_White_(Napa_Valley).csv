description: From Chiles Valley, this blend of 71% Semillon and 29% Sauvignon Blanc is one of the best wines of its type of the vintage. Cofermented and barrel aged in 15% new French oak, it shows extraordinary richness, and savory flavors of green and yellow tree fruits, green tea, cashew, Asian spices and gingery vanilla. It even has some dusty tannins that make for grip and structure. The finish is absolutely dry..
