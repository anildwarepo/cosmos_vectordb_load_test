country: South Africa.
description: This Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend, with 25% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc, is complex and intriguing. It boasts a full profile of ripe fruit tones, expressed in layers of baked cherry, plum and rhubarb cake that are accented by notes of cured bacon, leather and pressed purple flowers. The palate is surprisingly smooth and silky, thanks to resolved, approachable tannins and a lingering sweet-smoke hit on the finish..
