country: US.
description: This blend of 47% Grenache, 35% Mourvèdre and 18% Syrah is reminiscent of a walk through the dewy sagebrush, with dried wild herbs most prominent alongside cola, rustic plum and mulberry and a hint of pine forest. Those forest-like flavors show on the sip as well, with bay leaf, green peppercorn and a savory salts enhancing the baked berry and tangy plum skin elements—a GSM with teeth and structure..
