wine_Boudreaux_Cellars_2007_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Washington),"Unnamed: 0: 94246.
country: US.
description: This is a Bordeaux-style blend, principally Cabernet Sauvignon, with small amounts of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. It's stylish and firm, based upon a solid cassis note. The extended barrel aging—32 months in French oak—brings on seductive flavors of brown sugar, molasses and maple syrup, with touches of espresso and dark chocolate. The structure remains tight and polished, with excellent balance..
