country: US.
description: Sashi Moorman and Rajat Parr love to pick early, and it shows with aromas of stewed tomatoes, green olives, green cardamom and Eastern European spices. It's very savory and wakes up the palate with vinegar-laden flavors reminiscent of North African tagines, and would make an excellent extra-spice accompaniment to a wide variety of foods. Expect this wine to grow in complexity and approachability 2018â€“2024..
