country: Austria.
description: Brooding, darkly aromatic fruit plays on the nose. The wild blueberry almost has a floral touch of peony. The palate still contains juicy fruit in a taut, firm structure, while tannins are fine but still crunchy. A bright streak of freshness brightens and guides everything, creating juicness and verve, and giving definition to that lovely, ripe fruit. This wine might take a little time to come out of its shell but is worth waiting for. Drink 2019–2025..
