wine_Kuentz-Bas_NV_Trois_Châteaux_Brut_Sparkling_(Crémant_d'Alsace),"Unnamed: 0: 105526.
country: France.
description: Luscious stone-fruit notes on the nose suggest ripeness and opulence. The palate speaks with that same generous fruit but holds a tight fresh grip that unites mirabelle, crisp green apple, bright citrus and yeasty richness. This is a beautifully balanced expressive wine with fine creamy fizz that is lovely now but will also reward laying down. The finish is long and deliciously dry and fresh. Drink 2017–2022..
