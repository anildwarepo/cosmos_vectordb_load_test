title: Strangely Stricken Dead.
text: There was once a man called Kim Tok-saing, a soldier of fortune, who had been specially honoured at the Court of Tai-jong. He had several times been generalissimo of the army, and on his various campaigns had had an intimate friend accompany him, a friend whom he greatly loved. But Kim had been dead now for some ten years and more, when one night this friend of his was awakened with a start and gave a great outcry. He slept again, but a little later was disturbed once more by a fright, at which he called out. His wife, not liking this, inquired as to what he meant. The friend said, “I have just seen General Kim riding on a white horse, with bow and arrows at his belt. He called to me and said, ‘A thief has just entered my home, and I have come to shoot him dead.’ He went and again returned, and as he drew an arrow from his quiver, I saw that there were blood marks on it. He said, ‘I have just shot him, he is dead.’” The husband and wife in fear and wonder talked over it together.When morning came the friend went to General Kim’s former home to make inquiry. He learned that that very night Kim’s young widow had decided to remarry, but as soon as the chosen fiancé had entered her home, a terrible pain shot him through, and before morning came he died in great agony..
