country: US.
description: Your classic Sonoma Coast flavors have a feral element, suggesting foresty mushrooms, pine cones and mineral things alongside the pomegranates and cranberries. That's just what you get in this bottling from Siduri. The chilly vintage has made it lighter and lower in alcohol than the rich 2007, but it's more elegance and complex. This is a very interesting wine, one to linger over as it breathes in the glass..
