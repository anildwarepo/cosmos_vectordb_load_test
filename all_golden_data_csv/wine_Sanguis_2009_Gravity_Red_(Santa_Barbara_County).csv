wine_Sanguis_2009_Gravity_Red_(Santa_Barbara_County),"Unnamed: 0: 58372.
country: US.
description: Sanguis combines its signature of exceptional power with finesse, producing a wine that is so dramatic as to defy belief. Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon provide the blackberry jam and chocolate richness, while Viognier brings a bright floral note, and even Roussanne has something to say by way of orange tartness. New oak is evident, but perfectly in balance with the wine's volume. Stunning and dramatic, but not an ager, so drink up..
