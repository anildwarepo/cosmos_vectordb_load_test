text: “In the world it’s always going up and down–and now I can’t go up anyhigher!” So said Ole the tower-keeper. “Most people have to try boththe ups and the downs; and, rightly considered, we all get to bewatchmen at last, and look down upon life from a height.”Such was the speech of Ole, my friend, the old tower-keeper, a strangetalkative old fellow, who seemed to speak out everything that cameinto his head, and who for all that had many a serious thought deep inhis heart. Yes, he was the child of respectable people, and there wereeven some who said that he was the son of a privy councillor, or thathe might have been; he had studied too, and had been assistant teacherand deputy clerk; but of what service was all that to him? In thosedays he lived in the clerk’s house, and was to have everything in thehouse, to be at free quarters, as the saying is; but he was still, soto speak, a fine young gentleman. He wanted to have his boots cleanedwith patent blacking, and the clerk could only afford ordinary grease;and upon that point they split–one spoke of stinginess, the other ofvanity, and the blacking became the black cause of enmity betweenthem, and at last they parted.This is what he demanded of the world in general–namely, patentblacking–and he got nothing but grease. Accordingly he at last drewback from all men, and became a hermit; but the church tower is theonly place in a great city where hermitage, office, and bread can befound together. So he betook himself up thither, and smoked his pipeas he made his solitary rounds. He looked upward and downward, and hadhis own thoughts, and told in his way of what he read in books and inhimself. I often lent him books, good books; and you may know a man bythe company he keeps. He loved neither the English governess-novels,nor the French ones, which he called a mixture of empty wind andraisin-stalks: he wanted biographies and descriptions of the wondersof the world. I visited him at least once a year, generally directlyafter New Year’s-day, and then he always spoke of this and that whichthe change of the year had put into his head.I will tell the story of three of these visits, and will reproduce hisown words whenever I can remember them.FIRST VISIT.Among the books which I had lately lent Ole, was one which had greatlyrejoiced and occupied him. It was a geological book, containing anaccount of the boulders.“Yes, they’re rare old fellows, those boulders!” he said; “and tothink that we should pass them without noticing them! And over thestreet pavement, the paving-stones, those fragments of the oldestremains of antiquity, one walks without ever thinking about them. Ihave done the very thing myself. But now I look respectfully at everypaving-stone. Many thanks for the book! It has filled me with thought,and has made me long to read more on the subject. The romance of theearth is, after all, the most wonderful of all romances. It’s a pityone can’t read the first volumes of it, because they ‘re written in alanguage that we don’t understand. One must read in the differentstrata, in the pebble-stones, for each separate period. Yes, it is aromance, a very wonderful romance, and we all have our place in it. Wegrope and ferret about, and yet remain where we are, but the ballkeeps turning, without emptying the ocean over us; the clod on whichwe move about, holds, and does not let us through. And then it’s astory that has been acting for thousands upon thousands of years, andis still going on. My best thanks for the book about the boulders.Those are fellows indeed! they could tell us something worth hearing,if they only knew how to talk. It’s really a pleasure, now and then tobecome a mere nothing, especially when a man is as highly placed as Iam. And then to think that we all, even with patent lacquer, arenothing more than insects of a moment on that ant-hill the earth,though we may be insects with stars and garters, places and offices!One feels quite a novice beside these venerable million-year-oldboulders. On New Year’s-eve I was reading the book, and had lostmyself in it so completely, that I forgot my usual New Year’sdiversion, namely, the wild hunt to Amack. Ah, you don’t know whatthat is!“The journey of the witches on broomsticks is well enough known–thatjourney is taken on St. John’s-eve, to the Brocken; but we have a wildjourney also, which is national and modern, and that is the journey toAmack on the night of the New Year. All indifferent poets andpoetesses, musicians, newspaper writers and artistic notabilities, Imean those who are no good, ride in the New Year’s-night through theair to Amack. They sit backwards on their painting brushes or quillpens, for steel pens won’t bear them, they’re too stiff. As I toldyou, I see that every New Year’s night, and could mention themajority of the riders by name, but I should not like to draw theirenmity upon myself, for they don’t like people to talk about theirride to Amack on quill pens. I’ve a kind of niece, who is a fishwife,and who, as she tells me, supplies three respectable newspapers withthe terms of abuse and vituperation they use, and she has herself beenat Amack as an invited guest; but she was carried out thither, for shedoes not own a quill pen, nor can she ride. She has told me all aboutit. Half of what she said is not true, but the other half gives usinformation enough. When she was out there, the festivities began witha song: each of the guests had written his own song, and each one sunghis own song, for he thought that the best, and it was all one, allthe same melody. Then those came marching up, in little bands, who areonly busy with their mouths. There were ringing bells that sangalternately; and then came the little drummers that beat their tattooin the family circle; and acquaintance was made with those who writewithout putting their names, which here means as much as using greaseinstead of patent blacking; and then there was the beadle with hisboy, and the boy was the worst off, for in general he gets no noticetaken of him; then too there was the good street-sweeper with hiscart, who turns over the dust-bin, and calls it “good, very good,remarkably good.” And in the midst of the pleasure that was affordedby the mere meeting of these folks, there shot up out of the greatdirt-heap at Amack a stem, a tree, an immense flower, a greatmushroom, a perfect roof, which formed a sort of warehouse for theworthy company, for in it hung everything they had given to the worldduring the Old Year. Out of the tree poured sparks like flames offire; these were the ideas and thoughts, borrowed from others, whichthey had used, and which now got free and rushed away like so manyfireworks. They played at ‘the stick burns,’ and the young poetsplayed at ‘heart-burns,’ and the witlings played off their jests, andthe jests rolled away with a thundering sound, as if empty pots werebeing shattered against doors. ‘It was very amusing!’ my niece said;in fact, she said many things that were very malicious but veryamusing, but I won’t mention them, for a man must be good-natured andnot a carping critic. But you will easily perceive that when a manonce knows the rights of the journey to Amack, as I know them, it’squite natural that on the New Year’s-night one should look out to seethe wild chase go by. If in the New Year I miss certain persons whoused to be there, I am sure to notice others who are new arrivals: butthis year I omitted taking my look at the guests. I bowled away on theboulders, rolled back through millions of years, and saw the stonesbreak loose high up in the North, saw them drifting about on icebergs,long before Noah’s ark was constructed, saw them sink down to thebottom of the sea, and reappear with a sand-bank, with that one thatpeered forth from the flood and said, ‘This shall be Zealand!’ I sawthem become the dwelling-place of birds that are unknown to us, andthen become the seat of wild chiefs of whom we know nothing, untilwith their axes they cut their Runic signs into a few of these stones,which then came into the calendar of time. But as for me, I had gonequite beyond all lapse of time, and had become a cipher and a nothing.Then three or four beautiful falling stars came down, which clearedthe air, and gave my thoughts another direction. You know what afalling star is, do you not? The learned men are not at all clearabout it. I have my own ideas about shooting stars, as the commonpeople in many parts call them, and my idea is this: How often aresilent thanksgivings offered up for one who has done a good and nobleaction! the thanks are often speechless, but they are not lost for allthat. I think these thanks are caught up, and the sunbeams bring thesilent, hidden thankfulness over the head of the benefactor; and if itbe a whole people that has been expressing its gratitude through along lapse of time, the thankfulness appears as a nosegay of flowers,and at length falls in the form of a shooting star upon the good man’sgrave. I am always very much pleased when I see a shooting star,especially in the New Year’s-night, and then find out for whom thegift of gratitude was intended. Lately a gleaming star fell in thesouth-west, as a tribute of thanksgiving to many, many! ‘For whom wasthat star intended?’ thought I. It fell, no doubt, on the hill by theBay of Flensberg, where the Danebrog waves over the graves ofSchleppegrell, Läslöes, and their comrades. One star also fell in themidst of the land, fell upon Sorö, a flower on the grave of Holberg,the thanks of the year from a great many–thanks for his charmingplays!“It is a great and pleasant thought to know that a shooting star fallsupon our graves; on mine certainly none will fall–no sunbeam bringsthanks to me, for here there is nothing worthy of thanks. I shall notget the patent lacquer,” said Ole; “for my fate on earth is onlygrease, after all.”SECOND VISIT.It was New Year’s-day, and I went up on the tower. Ole spoke of thetoasts that were drunk on the transition from the old year into thenew, from one grave into the other, as he said. And he told me a storyabout the glasses, and this story had a very deep meaning. It wasthis:“When on the New Year’s-night the clock strikes twelve, the people atthe table rise up, with full glasses in their hands, and drain theseglasses, and drink success to the New Year. They begin the year withthe glass in their hands; that is a good beginning for topers. Theybegin the New Year by going to bed, and that’s a good beginning fordrones. Sleep is sure to play a great part in the New Year, and theglass likewise. Do you know what dwells in the glass?” asked Ole. “Iwill tell you–there dwell in the glass, first, health, and thenpleasure, then the most complete sensual delight: and misfortune andthe bitterest woe dwell in the glass also. Now suppose we count theglasses–of course I count the different degrees in the glasses fordifferent people.“You see, the _first glass_, that’s the glass of health, and in thatthe herb of health is found growing; put it up on the beam in theceiling, and at the end of the year you may be sitting in the arbourof health.“If you take the _second glass_–from this a little bird soarsupwards, twittering in guileless cheerfulness, so that a man maylisten to his song and perhaps join in ‘Fair is life! no downcastlooks! Take courage and march onward!’“Out of the _third glass_ rises a little winged urchin, who cannotcertainly be called an angel-child, for there is goblin blood in hisveins, and he has the spirit of a goblin; not wishing to hurt or harmyou, indeed, but very ready to play off tricks upon you. He’ll sit atyour ear and whisper merry thoughts to you; he’ll creep into yourheart and warm you, so that you grow very merry and become a wit, sofar as the wits of the others can judge.“In the _fourth glass_ is neither herb, bird, nor urchin: in thatglass is the pause drawn by reason, and one may never go beyond thatsign.“Take the _fifth glass_, and you will weep at yourself, you will feelsuch a deep emotion; or it will affect you in a different way. Out ofthe glass there will spring with a bang Prince Carnival, nine timesand extravagantly merry: he’ll draw you away with him, you’ll forgetyour dignity, if you have any, and you’ll forget more than you shouldor ought to forget. All is dance, song, and sound; the masks willcarry you away with them, and the daughters of vanity, clad in silkand satin, will come with loose hair and alluring charms: but tearyourself away if you can!“The _sixth glass_! Yes, in that glass sits a demon, in the form of alittle, well-dressed, attractive and very fascinating man, whothoroughly understands you, agrees with you in everything, and becomesquite a second self to you. He has a lantern with him, to give youlight as he accompanies you home. There is an old legend about a saintwho was allowed to choose one of the seven deadly sins, and whoaccordingly chose drunkenness, which appeared to him the least, butwhich led him to commit all the other six. The man’s blood is mingledwith that of the demon–it is the sixth glass, and with that the germof all evil shoots up within us; and each one grows up with a strengthlike that of the grains of mustard seed, and shoots up into a tree,and spreads over the whole world; and most people have no choice butto go into the oven, to be re-cast in a new form.“That’s the history of the glasses,” said the tower-keeper Ole, “andit can be told with lacquer or only with grease; but I give it youwith both!”THIRD VISIT.On this occasion I chose the general “moving-day” for my visit to Ole,for on that day it is anything but agreeable down in the streets inthe town; for they are full of sweepings, shreds, and remnants of allsorts, to say nothing of the cast-off bed straw in which one has towade about. But this time I happened to see two children playing inthis wilderness of sweepings. They were playing at “going to bed,” forthe occasion seemed especially favourable for this sport: they creptunder the straw, and drew an old bit of ragged curtain over themselvesby way of coverlet. “It was splendid!” they said; but it was a littletoo strong for me, and besides, I was obliged to mount up on my visit.“It’s moving-day to-day,” he said; “streets and houses are like adust-bin, a large dust-bin; but I’m content with a cartload. I may getsomething good out of that, and I really did get something good out ofit, once. Shortly after Christmas I was going up the street; it wasrough weather, wet and dirty; the right kind of weather to catch coldin. The dustman was there with his cart, which was full, and lookedlike a sample of streets on moving-day. At the back of the cart stooda fir tree, quite green still, and with tinsel on its twigs: it hadbeen used on Christmas-eve, and now it was thrown out into the street,and the dustman had stood it up at the back of his cart. It was drollto look at, or you may say it was mournful–all depends on what youthink of when you see it; and I thought about it, and thought this andthat of many things that were in the cart: or I might have done so,and that comes to the same thing. There was an old lady’s glove too: Iwonder what that was thinking of? Shall I tell you? The glove waslying there, pointing with its little finger at the tree. ‘I’m sorryfor the tree,’ it thought; ‘and I was also at the feast, where thechandeliers glittered. My life was, so to speak, a ball-night: apressure of the hand, and I burst! My memory keeps dwelling upon that,and I have really nothing else to live for!’ This is what the glovethought, or what it might have thought. ‘That’s a stupid affair withyonder fir tree,’ said the potsherds. You see, potsherds thinkeverything is stupid. ‘When one is in the dust-cart,’ they said, ‘oneought not to give one’s self airs and wear tinsel. I know that I havebeen useful in the world, far more useful than such a green stick.’That was a view that might be taken, and I don’t think it quite apeculiar one; but for all that the fir tree looked very well: it waslike a little poetry in the dust-heap; and truly there is dust enoughin the streets on moving-day. The way is difficult and troublesomethen, and I feel obliged to run away out of the confusion; or if I amon the tower, I stay there and look down, and it is amusing enough.“There are the good people below, playing at ‘changing houses.’ Theytoil and tug away with their goods and chattels, and the householdgoblin sits in an old tub and moves with them; all the little griefsof the lodging and the family, and the real cares and sorrows, movewith them out of the old dwelling into the new; and what gain is therefor them or for us in the whole affair? Yes, there was written longago the good old maxim: ‘Think on the great moving-day of death!’That is a serious thought; I hope it is not disagreeable to you thatI should have touched upon it? Death is the most certain messengerafter all, in spite of his various occupations. Yes, Death is theomnibus conductor, and he is the passport writer, and he countersignsour service-book, and he is director of the savings bank of life. Doyou understand me? All the deeds of our life, the great and the littlealike, we put into this savings bank; and when Death calls with hisomnibus, and we have to step in, and drive with him into the land ofeternity, then on the frontier he gives us our service-book as a pass.As a provision for the journey he takes this or that good deed we havedone, and lets it accompany us; and this may be very pleasant or veryterrific. Nobody has ever escaped this omnibus journey: there iscertainly a talk about one who was not allowed to go–they call himthe Wandering Jew: he has to ride behind the omnibus. If he had beenallowed to get in, he would have escaped the clutches of the poets.“Just cast your mind’s eye into that great omnibus. The society ismixed, for king and beggar, genius and idiot, sit side by side: theymust go without their property and money; they have only theservice-book and the gift out of the saving’s bank with them. Butwhich of our deeds is selected and given to us? Perhaps quite a littleone, one that we have forgotten, but which has been recorded–small asa pea, but the pea can send out a blooming shoot. The poor bumpkin,who sat on a low stool in the corner, and was jeered at and flouted,will perhaps have his worn-out stool given him as a provision; and thestool may become a litter in the land of eternity, and rise up then asa throne, gleaming like gold, and blooming as an arbour. He who alwayslounged about, and drank the spiced draught of pleasure, that he mightforget the wild things he had done here, will have his barrel given tohim on the journey, and will have to drink from it as they go on; andthe drink is bright and clear, so that the thoughts remain pure, andall good and noble feelings are awakened, and he sees and feels whatin life he could not or would not see; and then he has within him thepunishment, the _gnawing worm_, which will not die through timeincalculable. If on the glasses there stood written ‘_oblivion_,’ onthe barrel ‘_remembrance_’ is inscribed.“When I read a good book, an historical work, I always think at lastof the poetry of what I am reading, and of the omnibus of death, andwonder which of the hero’s deeds Death took out of the savings bankfor him, and what provisions he got on the journey into eternity.There was once a French king–I have forgotten his name, for the namesof good people are sometimes forgotten, even by me, but it will comeback some day; there was a king who, during a famine, became thebenefactor of his people; and the people raised to his memory amonument of snow, with the inscription, ‘Quicker than this melts didstthou bring help!’ I fancy that Death, looking back upon the monument,gave him a single snow-flake as provision, a snow-flake that nevermelts, and this flake floated over his royal head, like a whitebutterfly, into the land of eternity. Thus too, there was a LouisXI.–I have remembered his name, for one remembers what is bad–atrait of him often comes into my thoughts, and I wish one could saythe story is not true. He had his lord high constable executed, and hecould execute him, right or wrong; but he had the innocent children ofthe constable, one seven and the other eight years old, placed underthe scaffold so that the warm blood of their father spurted over them,and then he had them sent to the Bastille, and shut up in iron cages,where not even a coverlet was given them to protect them from thecold. And King Louis sent the executioner to them every week, and hada tooth pulled out of the head of each, that they might not be toocomfortable; and the elder of the boys said, ‘My mother would die ofgrief if she knew that my younger brother had to suffer so cruelly;therefore pull out two of my teeth, and spare him.’ The tears cameinto the hangman’s eyes, but the king’s will was stronger than thetears; and every week two little teeth were brought to him on a silverplate; he had demanded them, and he had them. I fancy that Death took,these two teeth out of the savings bank of life, and gave them toLouis XI., to carry with him on the great journey into the land ofimmortality: they fly before him like two flames of fire; they shineand burn, and they bite him, the innocent children’s teeth.“Yes, that’s a serious journey, the omnibus ride on the greatmoving-day! And when is it to be undertaken? That’s just the seriouspart of it. Any day, any how, any minute, the omnibus may draw up.Which of our deeds will Death take out of the savings bank, and giveto us as provision? Let us think of the moving-day that is not markedin the calendar.”.
