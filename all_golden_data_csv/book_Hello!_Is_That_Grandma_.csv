Description: Who's on the phone? Lift the flaps and see! Imagine you dialled a wrong number-and got through to a sheep . . . then a cow . . . then a duck . . . then a very hungry crocodile! And all you wanted to do was wish your grandma 'Happy Birthday!' A bouncy riot of wrong numbers from best-selling author Ian Whybrow. Quirky illustrations by Deborah Allwright, and lots of fold-out flaps add to the fun..
