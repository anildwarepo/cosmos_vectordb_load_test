country: Argentina.
description: This pitch-dark, fully extracted Malbec from La Consulta in Mendoza's Uco Valley delivers blackberry, black pepper and brushy herbal aromas on what amounts to a massive, spot-on bouquet. Big, chewy and tannic on the palate, with earthy, roasted flavors of blackberry, prune, savory spices and raw oak, this finishes meaty, slightly salty and strong, with wild herb and black-fruit flavors. Drink through 2022..
