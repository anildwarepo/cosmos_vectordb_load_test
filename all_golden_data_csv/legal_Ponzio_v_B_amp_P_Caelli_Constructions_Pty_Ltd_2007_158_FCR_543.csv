case_title: Ponzio v B &amp; P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd (2007) 158 FCR 543.
case_text: is a repetition of what was said by French J in Trade Practices Commission v CSR Ltd (1991) ATPR p41-076 at 52,152. See also Trade Practices Commission v Pye Industries Sales Pty Ltd (1978) ATPR p40-089 at 17,859; Ponzio v B &amp; P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd (2007) 158 FCR 543 per Lander J at [93] and per Jessop J at [164]. The respondents referred to Ponzio , a recent Full Court decision about the imposition of penalties under the WR Act. This was a case against an employer under the former s 187AA and the CFMEU and two of its officials under former s 187AB of the WR Act. It concerned payment to employees for a period of industrial action. It adds nothing of significance to the relevant principles involved in the imposition of a penalty. In that case, a penalty of $5,000 was imposed on the employer; none of it was to be paid if the company did not breach any provision of the WR Act for a year. The employer was regarded as being less culpable than the union. A penalty of $6,000 was imposed on the CFMEU. No penalty was imposed on the two officials but declarations were made that they had breached the WR Act. This was the highest penalty imposed under those sections. The other penalties in the 4 earlier cases ranged from $200 to $4,000: [130]-[133] per Jessup J. There have been two cases where penalties have been imposed for contraventions of ss 127 and 178 of the former WR Act. I have given no weight in assessing the appropriate penalties to the view of the workforce that Ballard had been unfairly or unlawfully sacked or in relation to the asserted 'sharp practice' on the part of LKJV: Ponzio at [90] per Lander J. In any event I am unable, on the evidence, to conclude that the respondents' perception that Ballard was unfairly or unlawfully terminated was reasonably based or not. Nor am I in a position to characterise the conditions put by the LKJV for his reinstatement as constituting 'sharp practice', or as being provocative. There was no direct evidence as to this nor am I able to infer it. In any event, if Ballard considered that he had been either unfairly or unlawfully terminated in his employment, then he had both a contractual obligation and a remedy at law. There was a mandatory Dispute Resolution Procedure under the Certified Agreement (cl 4.5) for the resolution of disputes. Ballard was obliged to follow this. He did not. Additionally, an application for relief under s 643(1) of the WR Act was available to Ballard on the ground that the termination was allegedly harsh, unjust or unreasonable. Indeed it was a term of the LKJV New Metro Rail City Project Structural Certified Agreement 2004 that termination of employment by the Joint Venture shall not be harsh, unjust or unreasonable (cl 2.2.3). I was informed by senior counsel for the respondents that Ballard had made an application in relation to his alleged unfair dismissal, claiming that it was harsh, unjust and unreasonable and constituted discrimination. The respondents' perception that Ballard's dismissal was unfair or unlawful did not constitute a warrant for the unlawful industrial action, nor does it constitute any relevant mitigating circumstance. It would be extraordinary if a wilful disregard of the main object of the legislation, and in particular, in this case, the promotion of the rule of law, should be regarded as somehow mitigating the contravention. Mr Rozen, who represented the 7 th , 8 th , 9 th , 12 th , 14 th , 16 th , 28 th , 37 th and 64 th respondents, conceded in argument that the unlawful industrial action was, (in part) clearly motivated by an attempt to bring financial pressure to bear on the LKJV to achieve the reinstatement of Ballard rather than through lawful means. In my view, that concession was correctly made and underlines the seriousness of the conduct. I do not accept that merely because they are employees as opposed to a union, union officials, or an employer, that there is, in principle, any different approach which should be taken on the question of penalty. In any one case there may be different levels of culpability. Each matter requires to be considered by reference to its own facts and circumstances. I was told by senior counsel for the respondents that orders of the AIRC were frequently disobeyed and that this, traditionally, was not regarded as serious. It was also held that this was the first time in which penalty proceedings had been taken against employees in that capacity. This, it was said, was for historical reasons, grounded in the way that industrial disputes have in the past been fought. In Ponzio , a Full Federal Court made a series of detailed declarations concerning contraventions of the WR Act, on the basis of facts established by an agreed statement of facts. It is apparent from that form of declaration in that case that the Full Court was prepared to accept the detail in the agreed statement of facts as a proper factual foundation for the making of declarations. I propose that equivalent declarations should be made in this case. I certify that the preceding one hundred and sixteen (116) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gilmour.
