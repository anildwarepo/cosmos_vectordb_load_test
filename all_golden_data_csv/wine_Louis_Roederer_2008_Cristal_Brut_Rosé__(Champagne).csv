wine_Louis_Roederer_2008_Cristal_Brut_Rosé__(Champagne),"Unnamed: 0: 89739.
country: France.
description: Interestingly released after the softer 2009 version of this wine, this 2008 vintage is beautifully balanced between crisp fruit and ripe maturity. With its red fruits still in place, it also has a toasty yeasty edge that is sophisticated and enticing. It is a superb wine, delicious to drink now although because of the quality of the vintage it will age for many more years, certainly into the 2020s..
