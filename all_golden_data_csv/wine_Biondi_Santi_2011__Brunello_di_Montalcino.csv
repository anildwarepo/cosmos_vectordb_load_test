wine_Biondi_Santi_2011__Brunello_di_Montalcino,"Unnamed: 0: 117610.
country: Italy.
description: A few swirls of the glass release delicate, enticing aromas of red berry, rose, iris, tobacco, new leather and star anise on this elegant, almost ethereal wine. The restrained palate sneaks up you, offering tart cherry, crushed strawberry, white pepper and a note of black tea alongside a backbone of firm, refined tannins. Still primary and tight, it needs a few more years to fully open up and develop. Drink 2020–2031..
