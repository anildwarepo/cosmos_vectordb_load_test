Description: This guide provides readers with the theoretical background that is an essential foundation for studying and practicing with Patrol Rinpoche's Words of My Perfect Teacher. The author of the guide examines the role of the teacher in Tibetan Buddhist practice and relates the stages of the path to the Buddha's teachings on the Four Noble Truths, bringing it into perspective with an interesting overview. And, starting with a general introduction on how to approach the teachings, he goes through the original book chapter by chapter, filling in the background and putting each subject into greater perspective. Here are a few examples: - In the original text, Patrul encourages readers to have confidence in the ""Three Jewels""; the guide gives a detailed description of what the Three Jewels are. - Patrul stresses the importance of transcendent wisdom; the guide provides an introduction to Madhyamika philosophy, which is the basis of transcendent wisdom. - Patrul describes the importance of the sincerity of the student's Vajrasattva practice; the guide explains why this practice is so important and it lists the actions and karmic patterns that are addressed by the practice. - Patrul describes the Buddhist cosmology with a startling vision of the universe that encourages the reader to open his or her usual notions.
