country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Abrie Beeslaar. This wine is currently in it's infancy, with concentrated yet reserved and tight notes of brambly black berries, plums, spiced cherries, licorice and toasted spice on the nose sand mouth. There's some serious muscle to the firmly structured palate, with solid, gripping tannins and medium acidity that expresses the wine's overall balance in strength across the board. A pleasant salinity, almost like licking a mussel shell, presides over the long finish. Additional elegance and earthy complexity will surely develop with time. Drink 2022â€“2027..
