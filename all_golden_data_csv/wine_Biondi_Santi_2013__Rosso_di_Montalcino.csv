wine_Biondi_Santi_2013__Rosso_di_Montalcino,"Unnamed: 0: 105387.
country: Italy.
description: Vibrant and elegantly structured, this has delicate aromas of red berry, blue flower, aromatic herb and a whiff of cooking spice. The luminous, rather austere palate shows sour cherry, strawberry, star anise and a hint of pipe tobacco alongside youthfully assertive but refined tannins and racy acidity. This is one of the rare Rossos that will get better after a few more years in bottle. Drink 2018–2023..
