country: France.
description: Just a touch of dried pear and chamomile tisane appear on the shy nose which needs air to open. The palate already has that balm-like concentration of mature Riesling which is joined by a vein of wonderful lemon-zest freshness. Despite the absolute dryness of the palate there is ample, generous and deep-seated fruit: pear, apple and gorgeous tangerine. The finish is clean-cut and resonant. Drink now–2030..
