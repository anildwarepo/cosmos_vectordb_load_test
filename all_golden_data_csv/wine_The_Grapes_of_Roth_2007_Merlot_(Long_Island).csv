country: US.
description: Over the last few years, veteran winemaker Roman Roth's eponymous Merlot has proven to be a consistent winner. His 2007 vintage is no exception. While intensely ripe with a rich, almost raisined black-fruit character, it's balanced with hints of granite, smoke and brine that all lend a savory, earthy tone. Penetratingly tannic and robust in structure, it's a wine to decant now, or cellar through 2019â€“2021..
