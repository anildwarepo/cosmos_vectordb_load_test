unesco_heritage_Mining_Area_of_the_Great_Copper_Mountain_in_Falun,"Name: Mining Area of the Great Copper Mountain in Falun.
short_description: <p>The enormous mining excavation known as the Great Pit at Falun is the most striking feature of a landscape that illustrates the activity of copper production in this region since at least the 13th century. The 17th-century planned town of Falun with its many fine historic buildings, together with the industrial and domestic remains of a number of settlements spread over a wide area of the Dalarna region, provide a vivid picture of what was for centuries one of the world's most important mining areas.</p>.
