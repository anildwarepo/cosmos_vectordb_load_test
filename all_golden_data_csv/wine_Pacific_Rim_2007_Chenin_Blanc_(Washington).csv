country: US.
description: Pacific Rim is a Riesling specialist, but makes a limited amount of Chenin Blanc; clearly a labor of love. Rare attention is given to this sadly degraded tasting room grape; here it has a chance to express more of its thrilling complexity. Bone dry and loaded with lemon, grapefruit and melon fruit, this adds floral hints and sweet hay in the nose, while balancing its young, leesy flavors with bright acids..
