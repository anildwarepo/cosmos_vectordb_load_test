country: Spain.
description: Of all the Atauta single-vineyard wines from the sensational 2011 vintage, La Mala is arguably the most overtly oaky and modern in style. Grainy, resiny barrel-driven aromas come with controlled burn and heat. This is tannic and firm as cement, with ample oak resin creating a creamy feel. Resiny, fully spiced black-fruit flavors end with pepper, wood grain, burnt toast and other oaky notes. Drink from 2018â€“2031..
