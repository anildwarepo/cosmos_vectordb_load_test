country: Austria.
description: Very ripe notions of red-cheeked mirabelle plums and sun-ripened apricots with an edge of nettle shimmer on the nose. The palate is a clearly delineated but gorgeous canvas for foliage-fringed citrus—mandarin, clementine and tangerine all vie for space while yuzu adds spice and savor. There is generosity and slenderness. The finish is ultra clean and the entire wine is surprisingly approachable. Drink this now and rejoice, or keep it and look forward: In either case, this is a delicious fruity trinket of pure pleasure. Drink 2017–2040..
