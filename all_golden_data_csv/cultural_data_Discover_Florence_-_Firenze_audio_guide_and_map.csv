If you only need historical info on Florence I would highly recommend this app. Does not include recommendations like where to eat etc but it is probably the best audio guide app in the store for Florence. I've also bought Discover Pompei from the same developer and I wasn't disappointed. Easy to use and informative,I liked having both the audio and the written part for each location. We really enjoyed using the app to explore Florence. great information. saves a lot of money on tour guides Very interesting. The recorded voice is also very professional not computer generated as in other apps.
