country: France.
description: Very enticing but ever so ethereal notes of tropical fruit are hinted at: yellow and pink grapefruit, passion fruit and even some pineapple. The palate is still in thrall to all the primary citrus notes but holds promise of stone and riper fruit. This is taut, elegant, concentrated, dry and whistle-clean. Like a superlative sports car waiting to be sped around a race track. This spells raciness, subtle power and linearity. What a super-clean finish. Drink 2020–2035..
