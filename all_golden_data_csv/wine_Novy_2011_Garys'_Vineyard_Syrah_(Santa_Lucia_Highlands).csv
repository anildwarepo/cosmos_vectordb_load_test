wine_Novy_2011_Garys'_Vineyard_Syrah_(Santa_Lucia_Highlands),"Unnamed: 0: 7171.
country: US.
description: Some wineries releasing a new Garys' Syrah would charge a lot more, but Novy keeps their prices moderate. While this wine is enormously tannic and dry, it shows a complex range of blackberry and stone fruit, tobacco, currant, charred meat bone, black pepper and mineral flavors, with the oak influence evident but subtle. Given the extreme dryness and tannins, as well as significant alcohol, the question is will the wine age. It doesn't seem likely to, so decant and drink up through 2020..
