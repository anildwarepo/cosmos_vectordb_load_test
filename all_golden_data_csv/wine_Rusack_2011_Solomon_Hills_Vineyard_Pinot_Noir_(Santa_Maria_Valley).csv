description: With a wine this finely constructed, the question is always ageability. There's no question about the immediate deliciousness. It's thrilling with raspberries, strawberries, orange rind and cola, and complex notes of minerals and earth. The mouthfeel is absolutely beautiful, comprised of silk and satin brightened with acidity. So should you drink it now? Yes. Will it age? For the next six years, yes..
