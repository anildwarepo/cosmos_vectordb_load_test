country: US.
description: Grande is one of the most historic vineyards in southern Napa, still presided over by the lovely Dorothy Rossi, whose father planted the oldest vines here in 1920, the year she was born. The location, farming and age work together to offer aromas of dusty leather satchel and a richness of juicy blackberry and cranberry. Powerfully elegant and integrated, it evolves in the glass in a myriad of ways, surprising with every sip..
