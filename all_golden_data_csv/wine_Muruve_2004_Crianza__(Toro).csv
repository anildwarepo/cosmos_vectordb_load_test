country: Spain.
description: These are the kinds of Best Buys we love. In the case of Muruve's '04 crianza, the wine overdelivers by a sum and a half. The nose brims with cola, tar, menthol and other dark aromas, while the big but balanced palate delivers a belt of blackberry and plum flavors along with chewy, ripe tannins. Good now with grilled meat, but will age for another five years should you want to invest in more than one bottle..
