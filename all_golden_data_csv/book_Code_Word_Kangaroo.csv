Description: Gadgets, girls, and bad guys—Adam Sharp has everything the big boys have and more! Fifty-seven channels, and there’s nothing on—literally! When the world’s television satellites are blocked by just one station, the Happy Channel, superspy Adam Sharp, travels to the Australian Outback to investigate. But will the help of IM-8 agent Alice Springs, TV snake-wrangler Wayne Wallaby, and two kangaroos be enough to combat the evil mindwashing of the Happy Channel’s puppy dogs, candy, and birthday cake? In addition to the popular Golden Books Ghost Horse, Snake Camp, and Wild Horses, George Edward Stanley is the author of the Third Grade Detectives series for Simon & Schuster. George, a professor at Cameron University, teaches writing and foreign languages, including Albanian, Zulu, and Xhosa. The author lives in Lawton, OK..
