country: France.
description: The intense aroma of very ripe peach rises from the glass. There are nuances of orange peel, too. These become aromatically amplified on the rich, dense and almost grippy palate. There is great concentration and residual sweetness, countered by bitter pith and texture. This is mature and totally fluid, ample and generous but its maturity adds subtle tone to the eloquent aromas. The finish is medium dry and very, very long..
