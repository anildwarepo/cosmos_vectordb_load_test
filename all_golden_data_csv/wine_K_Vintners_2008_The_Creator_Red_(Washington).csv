wine_K_Vintners_2008_The_Creator_Red_(Washington),"Unnamed: 0: 83469.
country: US.
description: This edition of The Creator is a one-time only mix of 43% Cabernet Sauvignon from Stoneridge, 21% Cabernet from Cailloux, and 36% Syrah from Morrison Lane. It's edgy and tight, with sharply defined corners—herbal, with a leafy/stemmy note, well-integrated into wild, brambly berry fruits. The 50% new oak is virtually invisible at this point; it fills out the mouthfeel but does not show specifically..
