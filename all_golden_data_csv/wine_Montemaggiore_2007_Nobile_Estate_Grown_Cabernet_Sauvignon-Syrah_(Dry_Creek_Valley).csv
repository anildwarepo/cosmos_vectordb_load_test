country: US.
description: There aren't many California Cab-Syrah blends this satisfying. Perhaps the main reason, aside from good viticulture and winemaking, is the source, Dry Creek Valley, where the grapes got sweet and ripe in blackberry, currant, bacon and spice flavors, yet maintained enough acidity for balance. The tannins are a bit tough and brambly, but this is a delicious wine to drink now with richly sauced beef dishes..
