wine_Schloss_Vollrads_2007_Trockenbeerenauslese_-_375_ml_Riesling_(Rheingau),"Unnamed: 0: 64189.
country: Germany.
description: Starts off with some intriguing notes of musk and spice, the turns intensely sweet, with powerful honey and orange marmalade flavors that coat the mouth and refuse to leave. There's just too much sugar in the end, and not enough acid or minerality to provide the ideal balance. Still, it is impressive, and if you measure pleasure solely by grams per liter of residual sugar, this will surely strike gold..
