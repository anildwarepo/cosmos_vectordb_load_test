description: This is a tiny-production blend of 82% Cabernet Sauvignon and 18% Cabernet Franc, the latter sourced from Detert East Vineyard along the Oakville bench, the former from Hendry Ranch in western Napa. Made by Genevieve Janssens, it has an old-world soul with plenty of California complexity, balanced in woody notes of coconut flake and black cherry, the tannins are fine-grained and integrated. A simply gorgeous wine..
