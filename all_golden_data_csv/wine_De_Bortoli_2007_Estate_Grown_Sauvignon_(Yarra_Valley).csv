wine_De_Bortoli_2007_Estate_Grown_Sauvignon_(Yarra_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 94416.
country: Australia.
description: This medium-bodied wine is a stylistic departure from the stereotypical Aussie stainless-steel Sauvignon Blanc, being fermented and aged in old French oak barrels for eight months. The result is a citrusy wine with greater depth and richer texture, even some leesy, slightly toasty notes that complement rather than overwhelm the fruit. Drink nowâ€“2010, but it could surprise and develop even more interest over time..
