wine_Laurenz_V._2012_Four_Grüner_Veltliner_(Niederösterreich),"Unnamed: 0: 42712.
country: Austria.
description: Aromatic hints of creamy stone fruit swirls about the nose. There are hints of Mirabelle plums and yellow pear but on the palate very fine, smoky and exquisitely integrated notes of French oak appear. There is rich vanilla and cream but with a counterpoint of fresh, bright lemony acidity. While stylistically unusual this barrique-aged Grüner certainly is a delicious, creamy and serious wine. You'd never even guess it's already four-years-old. Ready now but will evolve. Drink 2016–2022..
