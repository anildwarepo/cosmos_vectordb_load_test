wine_Big_Basin_2014_Pinot_Noir_(Monterey_County),"Unnamed: 0: 79942.
country: US.
description: This appellation blend of Bradley Brown's Pinot projects aims at a low-alcohol, greener style, thanks to 85% whole-cluster inclusion, with green peppercorns, Kalamata olives, tomato leaf and even jalape√±o on the nose. Those qualities make the palate incredibly interesting though very light and what many consumers may find underripe, with touches of strawberry fruit, dried dill, graphite and eucalyptus..
