wine_Domaine_Zind-Humbrecht_2015_Clos_Windsbuhl_Pinot_Gris_(Alsace),"Unnamed: 0: 32239.
country: France.
description: A hint of flinty reduction still plays on the nose, barely letting any of the pure fruit notes escape but both ripe and crisp pear appear. The palate still shows some yeasty funk but convinces with purity, sheer power and concentration. This feels urgent and direct, strong and stony, boisterous with sheer force and drive. This needs time to settle but will be a very convincing, even forceful and energetic Pinot Gris with some bottle age. Drink 2020—2035..
