country: Australia.
description: RWT (unromantically derived from “Red Wine Trial”) is 100% Barossa Valley Shiraz, aged in 100% French oak. In some vintages, like this one, the combination is incredibly sumptuous, offering layers of blueberry and blackberry fruit intermingled elegantly with hints of French vanilla. It's long, subtle and complex on the finish—a stunning effort. It's approachable now, but should age well through 2030 or so..
