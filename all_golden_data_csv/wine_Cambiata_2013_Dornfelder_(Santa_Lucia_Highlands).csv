wine_Cambiata_2013_Dornfelder_(Santa_Lucia_Highlands),"Unnamed: 0: 103200.
country: US.
description: An incredibly dark wine by veteran winemaker Eric Laumann, this rarely tapped varietal offers lush and deep aromas of blackberry pie, black currant syrup, licorice soda and mint-chip ice cream. Velvety, tongue-tingling and extremely lengthy on the palate, it shows almost port-like flavors of milk chocolate, blueberry juice, peppery mint, cherry liqueur-filled chocolate and ripe raspberry-cranberry juice..
