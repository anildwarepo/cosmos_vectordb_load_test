country: Austria.
description: There is something both earthy and berry fruited on the nose: both dried and fresh fruit shine with richness. There is a totally unusual, lovely bitter edge to this fruit, like a marzipan richness at the edge of tart but with ripe fruit. Take this into your treasure chest of vinous curiosities: It more than deserves its place. This is dry but rich, tart but generous, and comes with its very own strong and forceful personality..
