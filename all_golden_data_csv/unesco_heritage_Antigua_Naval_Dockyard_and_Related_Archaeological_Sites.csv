unesco_heritage_Antigua_Naval_Dockyard_and_Related_Archaeological_Sites,"Name: Antigua Naval Dockyard and Related Archaeological Sites.
short_description: <p>The site consists of a group of Georgian-style naval buildings and structures, set within a walled enclosure. The natural environment of this side of the island of Antigua, with its deep, narrow bays surrounded by highlands, offered shelter from hurricanes and was ideal for repairing ships. The construction of the Dockyard by the British navy would not have been possible without the labour of generations of enslaved Africans since the end of the 18th century. Its aim was to protect the interests of sugar cane planters at a time when European powers were competing for control of the Eastern Caribbean.</p>.
