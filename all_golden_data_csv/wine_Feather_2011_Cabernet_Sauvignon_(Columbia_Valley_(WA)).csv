country: US.
description: Under the Feather label, this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon styled by Napa's Randy Dunn s the only one pure varietal red wine in the Long Shadows collection. Eucalyptus aromas rise instantly as it's poured, leading into a smooth, appealing flavors of plum and cassis fruit. It fades rather quickly, even after being open for a few hours, leaving just an impression of chocolate from the barrel aging. It lacks the heft of past vintages..
