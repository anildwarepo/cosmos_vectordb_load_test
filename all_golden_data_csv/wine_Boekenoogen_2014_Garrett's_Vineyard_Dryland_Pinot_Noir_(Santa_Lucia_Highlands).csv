description: This is the annual release of a small, isolated vineyard block that's dry-farmed and named for the winemaker. The unctuous bottling shows luxurious aromas of baked black cherries, cinnamon, clove, cream and a touch of iron. The rich dark red-fruit flavors show on the sip, where the surrounding chaparral herbs invade the palate, offering dried sagebrush, eucalyptus and a wild mint sensation that last deep into the finish..
