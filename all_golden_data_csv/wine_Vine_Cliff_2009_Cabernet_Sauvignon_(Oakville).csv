country: US.
description: This wine is always impressive, but its degree of greatness is vintage driven, suggesting its extreme sensitivity to the Oakville terroir. The 2009 is ageable and concentrated, better than the 2008 but falling short of the 2007, which approached perfection. Dry and tannic, it's rich in blackberries, black currants and dark chocolate flavors. The long, spicy finish only hints at the intensity. Hold until 2015, and it should have a long life for many years beyond..
