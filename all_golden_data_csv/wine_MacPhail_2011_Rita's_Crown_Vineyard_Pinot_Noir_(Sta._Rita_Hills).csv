country: US.
description: The fruit on this Pinot Noir is flashier than anything that MacPhail has produced in their Sonoma County Pinots. That likely is due to the long hangtime of the Santa Rita Hills. The grapes got enormously ripe and rich in raspberries and cherries, and the wine would be a simple fruit bomb were it not for the excellent structure and a certain tangy minerality that will help it age through 2020 to 2022..
