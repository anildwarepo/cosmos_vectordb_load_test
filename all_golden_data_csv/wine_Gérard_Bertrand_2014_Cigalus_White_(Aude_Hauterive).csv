wine_Gérard_Bertrand_2014_Cigalus_White_(Aude_Hauterive),"Unnamed: 0: 47170.
country: France.
description: This is a big, bold, powerful white, a blend of 80% Chardonnay, 15% Viognier and 5% Sauvignon Blanc. Oaky aromas of toast, hazelnut and sweet spice abound throughout, gracing the fruit elements of honeydew, baked apple, peach pit, clove-spiked orange and buttered nuts. The mouthfeel is round and broad, but with ample acidic lift to the palate and through the finish to keep things fresh. A gingered peach-white tea flavor lingers on the close; try after 2017..
