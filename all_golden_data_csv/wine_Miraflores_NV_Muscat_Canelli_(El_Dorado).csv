country: US.
description: What a rare, complex and spectacular wine. Well-aged and fortified wines like this are uncommon in California but this full-bodied and very sweet example proves it's possible. It has gorgeous aromas of apricot, honey and toasted nuts followed by expansive, ripe-and-spicy fruit flavors transformed by the aging process. The mouthfeel is lavish and full, enabling a wonderful finish that lasts for minutes..
