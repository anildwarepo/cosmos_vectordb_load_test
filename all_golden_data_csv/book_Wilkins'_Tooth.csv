Description: OWN BACK LIMITEDREVENGE ARRANGED, PRICE ACCORDING TO TASK, ALL DIFFICULT TASKS UNDERTAKEN, TREASURE HUNTED, ETC. It seemed like a marvellous scheme at the time! Frank and Jess had set up the business because they needed money - their pocket-money had been stopped just when Frank owed Buster Knell ten pence.

So they pinned up the notice on the potting-shed and waited for customers. But of course, nothing's ever THAT straightforward..
