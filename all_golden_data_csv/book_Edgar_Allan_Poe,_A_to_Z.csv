Description: More than 3,400 entries chart the life and work of Poe. Entries arearranged alphabetically and cover works (including essays and reviews as well as poems and tales) and characters. Entries for works contain publishing and dramatization history, a list of characters, and a synopsis of the plot. There is also coverage of people, places, and publications that played a role in Poe's life or helped shape his literary development. Coverage extends into the twentieth century with entries (Corman, Roger; Price, Vincent) related to film and musical adaptations. Terms in boldface type serve as cross-references. Following the entries are four appendixes: a chronology of Poe's life, a chronology of his works, a list of Poe research collections, and a bibliography..
