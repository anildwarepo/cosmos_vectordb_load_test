country: Austria.
description: Fresh, crunchy black and red cherries and aromatic blueberries seem to be dusted with white pepper and cinnamon: how very appetizing. The same freshness appears on the palate where the fruit is subsumed into a textured core. Oak just lends a little spice and structure but lets the fruit and its very own freshness pervade everything. At every turn, more cherry breaks through the supple tannic frame. Joyful , refreshing and balanced abundance sets the tone while spicy pepper echoes all the way..
