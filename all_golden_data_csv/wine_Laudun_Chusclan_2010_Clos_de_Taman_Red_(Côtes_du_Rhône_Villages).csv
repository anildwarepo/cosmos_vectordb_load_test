country: France.
description: This has an impenetrable black core with fuschia highlights. The vibrant, mineral-driven Old World nose has asphalt, charcoal and charred wood notes leading the way. Black currant, rhubarb, lingonberry and linden leaf carry the flavors. The dense, concentrated palate is taut—and slightly awkward—with marked acidity, mild viscosity and firm tannins. The prolonged finish is multidimensional and complex. This is a cuvée to follow as it shows plenty of potential. Drink now and for the next three years..
