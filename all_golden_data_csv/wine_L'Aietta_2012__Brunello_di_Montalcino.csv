wine_L'Aietta_2012__Brunello_di_Montalcino,"Unnamed: 0: 59986.
country: Italy.
description: Captivating wild berry, rose, chopped herb and baking spice aromas take center stage in this earthy, stunning wine. The palate mirrors the nose in vibrancy, delivering tight layers of wild cherry, star anise and white pepper notes. Fresh acidity and firm, refined tannins provide a polished framework. It's loaded with finesse and already delicious, but hold for even more complexity. Drink 2020–2032..
