country: Portugal.
description: Luis Patr√£o started the organic Vadio Project in 2005 to preserve the native Baga grape grown nine miles from the Atlantic Ocean. This vintage, spectacular throughout Portugal, is a ripe, jammy, fruity wine, with typically firm tannins from the Baga grape. The red plum and rich berry flavors at the core are cut by ample acidity. It is already soft enough to drink now, although it will be better from 2016..
