title: The Wolf and the Sheep.
text: A Wolf was worried and badly bitten by dogs, and lay a long time for dead. By and by he began to revive, and, feeling very hungry, called out to a passing Sheep and said, “Would you kindly bring me some water from the stream close by? I can manage about meat, if only I could get something to drink.” But this Sheep was no fool. “I can quite understand”, said he, “that if I brought you the water, you would have no difficulty about the meat. Good-morning.”.
