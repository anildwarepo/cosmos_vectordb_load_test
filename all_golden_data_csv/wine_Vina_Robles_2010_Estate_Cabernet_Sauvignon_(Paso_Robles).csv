country: US.
description: With modest alcohol and an attractive herbaceousness, this Cabernet Sauvignon is blended with a little Petit Verdot. For those looking for a drier, more linear wine, it offers a viable alternative to a Napa Cabernet. It's a great example of the art of blending, selected from five different vineyards all over Paso Robles. It's rich in blackberries, currants and sage. This is the winery's best Cabernet yet for such a good price..
