country: US.
description: This is a powerful, sappy, sensuous and fragrantly fruit-driven mix of Syrah from the Seven Hills, Clifton, Bacchus, Candy Mountain, Willard, Pheasant and Stone Tree vineyards—a true Columbia Valley potpourri. It's blended with 7% Grenache from Stone Tree as well, adding floral/violet highlights. It's a well-made Syrah that reflects the particular Washington profile of floral aromas, tart berry fruit and juicy acids. Excellent focus and definition in a style built for acid lovers..
