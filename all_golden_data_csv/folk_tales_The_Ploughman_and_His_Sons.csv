title: The Ploughman and His Sons.
text: The farmer’s patient care and toilAre oftener wanting than the soil.A wealthy ploughman drawing near his end,Call’d in his sons apart from every friend,And said, “When of your sire bereft,The heritage our fathers leftGuard well, nor sell a single field.A treasure in it is conceal’d:The place, precisely, I don’t know,But industry will serve to show.The harvest past, Time’s forelock take,And search with plough, and spade, and rake;Turn over every inch of sod,Nor leave unsearch’d a single clod.”The father died. The sons—and not in vain—Turn’d o’er the soil, and o’er again;That year their acres boreMore grain than e’er before.Though hidden money found they none,Yet had their father wisely done,To show by such a measure,That toil itself is treasure..
