Description: ""Seth and Peyton were best friends, bandmates, and rivals. The success that lifted their four-man band from Leyborough, England changed the world and very nearly shattered their minds along the way. At first it was one big part. Then it all went terribly wrong and then, somehow, incredibly right.""--Jacket..
