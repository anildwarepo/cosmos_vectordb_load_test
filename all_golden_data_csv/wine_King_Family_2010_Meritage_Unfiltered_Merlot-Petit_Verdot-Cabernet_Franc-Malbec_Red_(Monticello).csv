country: US.
description: This blend of 43% Merlot, 27% Petit Verdot, 22% Cabernet Franc and 8% Malbec continues King Family's spate of solid releases. The aromas are rich but restrained, showing layers of curry powder and dried basil, with notes of spiced blueberry compote and blackberry. The full-bodied palate kicks into overdrive, with intense flavors of black fruit and dried rose that fill in the soft core, but the tannic framework keeps them from seeming effusive..
