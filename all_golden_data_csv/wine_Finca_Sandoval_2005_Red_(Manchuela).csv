wine_Finca_Sandoval_2005_Red_(Manchuela),"Unnamed: 0: 115803.
country: Spain.
description: Ripe, sweet-smelling and “muy moderno,” but by no means is this Syrah-led warrior only fruit, bulk and oak. Spanish wine writer Victor de la Serna's wine gets better all the time. This vintage is like berry cake in a glass, but it's not short on anything, including acidity and tannic structure. Expect a blast of fruit flavor, intensity in reserve, and some forward oak, vanilla and butter. Should settle into form over the next 18 months..
