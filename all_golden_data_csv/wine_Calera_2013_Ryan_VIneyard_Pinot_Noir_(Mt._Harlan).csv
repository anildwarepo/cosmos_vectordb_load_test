country: US.
description: A bushel of black cherries blends with slate, bay leaf, thyme and dried lilacs on the nose of this Josh Jensen bottling, which shows an amazing amount of aging potential. The palate is wound tightly by fine-grained tannins, which are starting to give a peek at the layered flavors of cranberry, pencil lead, thyme, bay leaf, pressed violets and dried citrus that patiently await their turns to shine. Drink 2018 through 2033..
