wine_Clément_Klur_NV_Sparkling_(Crémant_d'Alsace),"Unnamed: 0: 129062.
country: France.
description: Ripe and exquisitely pure notes of yellow apple perfume the nose and palate, against a bready, biscuity, rich and complex canvas of autolytic development. Freshness pervades and the very fine, pin-prick of mousse makes these flavors unite and sing. The dryness accentuates both purity and precision of this wine. Real class and pedigree shine brightly and are even more evident in the lingering finish..
