country: Germany.
description: This is a rather big and burly wine for a Mosel spätlese, weighing in at 11.5% alcohol. And while it shows plenty of power, it also shows nuance in its aromas and flavors, which range from baked fruit, honey and spiced marmalade to oily, mineral essences. Has the concentration to age, but the balance of sugar and alcohol may not hold in the long run—drink it over the next few years to avoid disappointment..
