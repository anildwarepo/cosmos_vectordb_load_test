wine_21_Grams_2011_Red_(Washington),"Unnamed: 0: 93396.
country: US.
description: This wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon (85%) along with 9% Petit Verdot and 6% Malbec, with most of the fruit coming from top sites of Cold Creek Vineyard and Stone Tree vineyards. Tightly wound up right now, it offers aromas of high-toned herbs, vanilla, spice and dark fruit. The palate is soft and flavorful, with plush yet delicate cherry flavors and fine-grained tannins that lead to an extended, fruit-filled finish. It's a very sophisticated wine with a long life in front of it. Best from 2021 to 2030..
