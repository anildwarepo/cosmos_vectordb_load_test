wine_Trimbach_2014_Riesling_(Alsace),"Unnamed: 0: 91469.
country: France.
description: The nose shows restrained citrus and a slightly lifted, very slightly aromatic touch of conifer. The palate is taut and slender, presenting sober, clean citrus flavors. This stands upright and has a wonderful backbone of freshness. I feel it will have more to give in the future. It's refreshing now and promising in the future. The finish is so subtly fruited that this will be worth the wait. Drink now through 2030..
