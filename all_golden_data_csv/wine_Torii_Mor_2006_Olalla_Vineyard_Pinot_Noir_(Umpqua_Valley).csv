wine_Torii_Mor_2006_Olalla_Vineyard_Pinot_Noir_(Umpqua_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 26119.
country: US.
description: This tastes like fruit from a cooler, perhaps higher altitude site. It's got a bracing minerality that runs through the fruit and gives the wine a solid backbone. Rhubarb and cranberry fruit is tightly laced against that rocky core, with plenty of natural acid propping up the finish. Little oak flavor is evident right now, though 38% of the barrels were new. This wine should be decanted, but as it opens it really shines..
