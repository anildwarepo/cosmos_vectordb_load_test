wine_Horsepower_2014_The_Tribe_Vineyard_Syrah_(Walla_Walla_Valley_(OR)),"Unnamed: 0: 1082.
country: US.
description: Lighter in color, this wine is aromatic and expressive, with notes of fire pit, blood, black olive tapenade, sea salt, black pepper, cured meat, nori, crushed flowers and umami. The palate brings soft, lithe, focused notes of earth and savory flavors that shimmer on the salty finish. It's all about delicacy but the aroma and flavor expression is compelling. Give it some time in the cellar or decant..
