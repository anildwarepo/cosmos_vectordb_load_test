wine_Eola_Hills_2006_Pinot_Noir_(Oregon),"Unnamed: 0: 115814.
country: US.
description: Where else in this country can you find $12 Pinot with actual varietal character? Yes, it's quite young, light, lean, tart and even simple, but it does taste like the grape it's made from, and avoids the vegetal and the overtly leathery qualities of many of its rivals. Gentle flavors of raspberry and cherry are supported with juicy acids and hints of spice. This would be a lovely companion to a simple roast chicken..
