country: Australia.
description: Predominantly Grenache, with smaller amounts of Shiraz and Mourvèdre, but the aromas reflect the Mourvèdre's tendency toward dark fruit and tree bark. The flavors show some redder fruit flavors—raspberries—as well as touches of caramel and rhubarb, and this slightly syrupy wine finishes with a tangy edge. It's a little eccentric in style and flavor profile, but savory and tasty in its own way—and a relative bargain..
