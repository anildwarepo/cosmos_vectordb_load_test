unesco_heritage_Cultural_Landscape_of_Sintra,"Name: Cultural Landscape of Sintra.
short_description: <p>In the 19th century Sintra became the first centre of European Romantic architecture. Ferdinand II turned a ruined monastery into a castle where this new sensitivity was displayed in the use of Gothic, Egyptian, Moorish and Renaissance elements and in the creation of a park blending local and exotic species of trees. Other fine dwellings, built along the same lines in the surrounding <em>serra</em> , created a unique combination of parks and gardens which influenced the development of landscape architecture throughout Europe.</p>.
