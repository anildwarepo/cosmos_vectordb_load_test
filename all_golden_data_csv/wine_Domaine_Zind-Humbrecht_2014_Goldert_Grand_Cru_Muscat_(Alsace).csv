country: France.
description: The nose is most restrained: the slightest notions of jasmine and nettle appear. With more air, a faint hint of orange peel emerges. The palate is one of streamlined slenderness and precision. This is like a dry laser beam festooned with honeysuckle blossom and fresh lemon zest. There is something that draws you ever deeper into stone and citrus. The lightness of the dry palate remains simply astonishing..
