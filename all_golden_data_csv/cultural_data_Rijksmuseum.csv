It leads you effortlessly from one Masterpiece to the next where it provides interesting, insightful information . There is NO NEED to rent an audio-guide at the Museum since this app mirrors the guide exactly. (NOTE: While it is not required --- for the best experience bring your own headset.) I used it some moths ago just fine and now they just ""stopped supporting"" my device... come on, is just an android that works perfectly do not limit your app devices to the most recent so everything is flawles and you won't get bad reviews. Bad move! This guide is for people that have good orientation, otherwise you will get lost. It is not intuitive at all. My recommendation is to put numbers on each painting and then to put list on this guide. Brilliant, really made my visit to the museum much much better. Highly recommended!.
