country: US.
description: This is one of the best Pinots Riverbench has produced. It's a delight to drink, with a silky, gentle texture and crisp acidity to get your mouth watering. For all the lightness of mouthfeel, the flavors are serious, suggesting raspberries and cherries with earthy notes of mushrooms, cola and herb tea. It would not be surprising if this wine was still gaining traction in 2020, but you can decant it and drink it now..
