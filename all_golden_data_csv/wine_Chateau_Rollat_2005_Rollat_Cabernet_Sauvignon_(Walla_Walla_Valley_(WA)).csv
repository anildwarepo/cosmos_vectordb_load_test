country: US.
description: Rollat is the mid-level red wine of the three inaugural releases from Chateau Rollat. It's less brooding and compact than the companion Edouard Cabernet. Immediately accessible, it could almost be the template for this new and exciting producer; elegant, polished and supple with ripe sweet fruit and fine tannins. Flavors of black cherry and cassis envelop the palate, gently spreading out into a full-on fruit rainbow..
