country: US.
description: This is the best Jewel Block bottling ever from Dutton. The vineyard is in the heart of Green Valley, one of the coolest parts of Russian River, and the magnificent vintage has yielded a fantastically ripe wine, balanced with rich, crisp acidity. The flavors of cherries, raspberries, cola, tangerine zest and dusty Asian spices are rich and deep, but the wine is very young. Give it until mid-2008, and it will drink well through 2013, at least..
