country: US.
description: A standout amid a number of excellent red wines from winemaker Anthony Nappa, this unoaked Cabernet Franc (made with indigenous yeast) shines a spotlight on Cabernet Franc's raw, somewhat vulnerable expression. It's unabashedly herbal and green, almost minty, yet simultaneously luscious and berried in flavor. It's fleshy in its suppleness, yet elegantly framed within a structure of taut tannins and acidity..
