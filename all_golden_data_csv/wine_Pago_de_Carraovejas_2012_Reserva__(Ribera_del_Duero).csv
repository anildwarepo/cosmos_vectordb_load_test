country: Spain.
description: Like it's bigger sibling El Anejón, this Reserva from a warm vintage is almost one-quarter Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in addition to Tinto Fino (Tempranillo). The opening of burnt earth, brandied cherry, rubber and herbal aromas is distinct. This feels a bit tough and chewy, with boysenberry, cassis, vanilla-cream and herbal spice flavors. A fairly smooth finish is young and vital. This should improve with aging. Best from 2019–2026..
