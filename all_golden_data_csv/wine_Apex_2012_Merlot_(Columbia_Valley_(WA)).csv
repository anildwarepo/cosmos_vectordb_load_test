country: US.
description: A blend of fruit from Elephant Mountain, Dionysus, Red Haven, Alder Ridge and Seven Hills vineyards, this fruit-forward wine offers aromas of cocoa, vanilla, anise, raspberry jam and fruit leather. The cranberry and raspberry flavors are sweet, rich and concentrated, backed by lightly grainy tannins. It seems a bit advanced for its age but brings a delicious factor that is hard to ignore. Drink now..
