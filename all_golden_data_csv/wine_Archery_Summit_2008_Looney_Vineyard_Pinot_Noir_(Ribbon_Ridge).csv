country: US.
description: The Looney Vineyard bottling is the outlier in the Archery Summit lineup—a different AVA and a non-estate vineyard. The Ribbon Ridge AVA is a subset of a subset within the Willamette Valley, and it may be the hidden gem for producing great Pinot Noir. This wine is sensual, spirited, spicy and smooth. The cherry and raspberry fruit is highlighted with bright acidity and whiffs of baking spices. The new oak is gently applied and the use of wild yeasts may have added some textural nuances also..
