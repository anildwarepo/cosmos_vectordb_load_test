title: The Stag and the Vine.
text: A stag, by favour of a vine,Which grew where suns most genial shine,And form’d a thick and matted bowerWhich might have turn’d a summer shower,Was saved from ruinous assault.The hunters thought their dogs at fault,And call’d them off. In danger now no moreThe stag, a thankless wretch and vile,Began to browse his benefactress o’er.The hunters, listening the while,The rustling heard, came back,With all their yelping pack,And seized him in that very place.“This is,” said he, “but justice, in my case.Let every black ingrateHenceforward profit by my fate.”The dogs fell to—’twere wasting breathTo pray those hunters at the death.They left, and we will not revile ’emA warning for profaners of asylum..
