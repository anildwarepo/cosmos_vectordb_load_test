country: Italy.
description: This is a gorgeous, crisp white wine with a slightly herbal dimension and drying mineral tones that frame a solid core of stone fruit, pear and melon. This is the first vintage of a fascinating wine that represents a piece of enological archeology: Once-abandoned Grillo vineyards on the tiny, but ruined-filled, island of Mozia (off the coast of Marsala, Sicily) have recently been revived. Only accessible by boat, this is a dreamy destination for wine tourists..
