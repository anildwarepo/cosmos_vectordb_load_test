country: US.
description: This Bordeaux blend has a different artist's label every year but otherwise has no identity of its own. This new release is tight, hot and shows signs of reduction; it's got a burnt rubber scent underlying the ultraripe, almost pruny fruit. It's just not a compelling wine; it hasn't jelled and it doesn't seem as if it will. There is concentration and power to be sure, but pleasure is in short supply..
