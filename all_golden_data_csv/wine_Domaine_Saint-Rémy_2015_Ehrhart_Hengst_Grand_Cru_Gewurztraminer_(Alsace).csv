country: France.
description: A lifted lemon-scented nose of peach gives and impression of ease and lightness. The palate, however, lays on generous sweetness to focus on ripe juicy peach notes. There is a huge concentration of flavor and richness, countered by that lemony freshness. This is a big but gentle wine that leaves your mind ringing with peach and lemon and a touch of honeysuckle spice. The medium-sweet finish is long and balanced. Drink 2017–2017..
