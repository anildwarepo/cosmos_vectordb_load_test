wine_Brooks_2015_Amycas_White_(Willamette_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 22324.
country: US.
description: This is one of those kitchen sink blends that is better than it has a right to be. Riesling, Pinot Blanc, Muscat, Gewürztraminer and Pinot Gris are all in the mix, and the wine is both aromatic and packed with fresh flavors of bubble gum and tropical fruit candy. It's finished dry, yielding a multipurpose, unique white wine that you may try with just about any food you'd put in front of any of the component grapes..
