country: South Africa.
description: A complex and layered wine, this is always one of South Africa's top Chenin Blancs. The bouquet opens with notes of chalk, lanolin, toasted apple skin, blanched almond and clove-studded orange peel. The palate is toasty, but well integrated; the apple, apricot and melon fruit core marry harmoniously with the wood and sweet spice characteristics. Round and smooth in texture, but with ample acidity to keep the mouthfeel fresh and the finish bright. Drink nowâ€“2017..
