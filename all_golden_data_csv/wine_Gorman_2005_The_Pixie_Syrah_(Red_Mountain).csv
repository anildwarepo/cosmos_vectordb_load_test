country: US.
description: A tannic, brambly, earthy wine, this pure Red Mountain Syrah was kept in neutral oak and minimally racked. At first it shows a tart and chalky character; then there begins to emerge lovely concentrated black cherry and loganberry fruit, along with a backbone of ash, graphite and coffee. On the second day it has softened and expanded with an engaging mix of fruit, herb, pepper and Red Mountain rock..
