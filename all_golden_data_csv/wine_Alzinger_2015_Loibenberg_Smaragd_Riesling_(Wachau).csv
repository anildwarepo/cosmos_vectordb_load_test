wine_Alzinger_2015_Loibenberg_Smaragd_Riesling_(Wachau),"Unnamed: 0: 122499.
country: Austria.
description: The nose is closed, but the palate speaks of concentration and a stony core that is still tightly coiled. Once this is ready, it will unfurl into glorious lemon zest and oil notions. For now, this is taut and tight, secretive and closed. There is an implicit stony slenderness, which has a heart of generous fruit buried at its core. This comes with a great promise of future glory, immense direction and concentration. Drink 2020–2040..
