wine_J.L._Chave_1999__Hermitage,"Unnamed: 0: 100002.
country: France.
description: Jean-Louis, the son of Gérard Chave, is now in charge of the family business, as well as being president of the Hermitage wine producers. He is continuing the family tradition of making powerful statements of Syrah from Hermitage, combining massive structure and over-powering perfumes. This 1999 seems to have the best of the traditional world of tannic immensity and the modern world of beautiful, ripe fruit. A wine that will age for a very long time..
