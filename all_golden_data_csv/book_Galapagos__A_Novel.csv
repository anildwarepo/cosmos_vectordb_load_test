Description: The ghost of a decapitated shipbuilder wryly observes the decline of the human race as reflected by a group of shipwreck survivors, including a biology teacher, a bomb-radiated wife of a Japanese computer genius, and a gold digger, a motley band whose fates are shaped by infertility and a local tribe of cannibals.
