wine_Rôtie_Cellars_2008_Southern_Blend_Red_Red_(Washington),"Unnamed: 0: 83344.
country: US.
description: The percentage of Grenache has been bumped up in Rôtie's second vintage, now at 70%, with the rest an even split between Syrah and Mourvèdre. Soft and spicy scents are laced with a mix of rock and vanilla. This nicely structured yet approachable wine might be mistaken for a Washington take on Priorat. The underlying minerality gives the light, plummy fruit a solid footing, and extends the length considerably..
