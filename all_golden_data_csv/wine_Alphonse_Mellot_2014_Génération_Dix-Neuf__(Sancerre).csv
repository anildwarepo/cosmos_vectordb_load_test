description: There have been 19 (dix-neuf) generations of Mellots making wine in Sancerre; at least one of them in each generation has been named Alphonse. This wine celebrates the history and the great quality of the family's wines today. It is richly endowed with both the beautifully ripe fruit and with a sophisticated acidity and texture.
