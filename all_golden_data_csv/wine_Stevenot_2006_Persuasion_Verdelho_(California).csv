country: US.
description: Stevenot has tinkered with Verdelho for years, and the work is paying off. This is a wonderful wine that fills a much needed niche in California whites. It's dry and crisp in the way of Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio, but incredibly rich in flavors of honeysuckle flowers, peaches, pineapples and vanilla cream, with a steely minerality that makes the finish bracing. Try as an alternative to Chardonnay..
