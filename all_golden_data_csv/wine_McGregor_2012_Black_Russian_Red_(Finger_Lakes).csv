country: US.
description: This robust concentrated red is made from an unusual field blend of Sereksiya Charni and Saperavi, two grape varieties more known in Eastern Europe than the United States. It's lush in black-cherry flavor, accented with chocolate, black pepper, vanilla and spice, but also densely tannic and searing in acidity. While unwieldy in its youth, it's a wine that consistently shows excellence with maturity. Hold till 2025..
