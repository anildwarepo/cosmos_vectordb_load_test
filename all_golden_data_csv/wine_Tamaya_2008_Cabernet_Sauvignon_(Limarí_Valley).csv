country: Chile.
description: Tamaya seems to have turned the corner with its 2008 Cabs (the reserva is also very good). This wine is condensed and concentrated, with blackberry jam and other sweet berry aromas. The palate is pure and tastes of cassis and black fruit, while the finish has cola notes and a slight tannic bite. Generous for the price. Imported by Ecovalley Quality Wine Group and National Refrescos Import Company, LLC..
