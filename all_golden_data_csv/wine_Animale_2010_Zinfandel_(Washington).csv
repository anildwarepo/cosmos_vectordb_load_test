wine_Animale_2010_Zinfandel_(Washington),"Unnamed: 0: 17110.
country: US.
description: A complex blend of 76% Zinfandel, 13% Petite Sirah, 6% Mourvèdre and 5% Syrah, this opens with hints of raisins and Ruby Port, a reflection of the near-16% alcohol. But the wine is neither jammy nor hot, and the flavors bring concentrated raspberry and cherry compote, surprising acidity, and some intense herbal and stem highlights. All in all a big, chunky, potent wine that captures the distinctive style of this unique mini-micro winery..
