text: Lapluck and Cæsar brothers were, descendedFrom dogs by Fame the most commended,Who falling, in their puppyhood,To different masters anciently,One dwelt and hunted in the boundless wood;From thieves the other kept a kitchen free.At first, each had another name;But, by their bringing up, it came,While one improved upon his nature,The other grew a sordid creature,Till, by some scullion called Lapluck,The name ungracious ever stuck.To high exploits his brother grew,Put many a stag at bay, and toreFull many a trophy from the boar;In short, him first, of all his crew,The world as Cæsar knew;And care was had, lest, by a baser mate,His noble blood should e’er degenerate.Not so with him of lower station,Whose race became a countless nation—The common turnspits throughout France—Where danger is, they don’t advance—Precisely the AntipodesOf what we call the Cæsars, these!Oft falls the son below his sire’s estate:Through want of care all things degenerate.For lack of nursing Nature and her gifts,What crowds from gods become mere kitchen-thrifts!.
