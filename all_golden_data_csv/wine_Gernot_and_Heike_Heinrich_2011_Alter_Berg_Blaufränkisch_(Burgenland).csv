country: Austria.
description: This is a compelling red for those who like a bit of mystery: is it red or black cherry? Or possibly, dark, aromatic elderberry? Oak spicily supports this interchange of fruit, and firm tannins lend structure while the fresh acidity keeps it lively. It's almost like a whole cast of characters were lined up in this wine for your entertainment. The lingering finish is especially convincing. This will get even better with cellaring; drink from 2016..
