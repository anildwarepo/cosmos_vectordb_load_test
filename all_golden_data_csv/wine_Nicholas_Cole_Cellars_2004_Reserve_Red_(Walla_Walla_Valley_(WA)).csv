country: US.
description: This ripe, rich, almost decadently thick wine is about as close as a Washington vintner can come to the decadently ripe style of the cultish Bordeaux blends of California. Along with the unctuous New World fruit, sap and flesh, there are thick, ripe tannins and a vivid acid underpinning. It drinks well right out of the bottle, the flavors beautifully wrapped together, mixing black fruits, black olives, herb and earth, smoke and coffee and toast..
