country: US.
description: This is sourced from the Maresh vineyard, which dates back to 1970. These older vines deliver that extra dollop of texture and mouthfeel that elevates the drinking experience. Powerful and yet elegant, it brings a panoply of berries, baking spices, Asian spices, nougat, caramel and milk chocolate. It delivers all of this and more, without feeling heavy or overblown. It drank even better after being open a full 24 hours..
