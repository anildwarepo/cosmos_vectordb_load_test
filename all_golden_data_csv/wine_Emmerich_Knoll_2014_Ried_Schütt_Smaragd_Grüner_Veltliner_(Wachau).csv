country: Austria.
description: An overtone of leesy yeast quickly gives way to lemony freshness, rounded out by hints of yellow plum and peach. Citrus also continues to be the focus on the palate: fresh zest of ripe lemons and Meyer lemons just edged by peppery spice. This is taut and very linear, streamlined, concentrated and slender but still tightly wound. This will relax into more spice and fruit with a little while in bottle. Right now it is a zesty, evocative mouthful of promise..
