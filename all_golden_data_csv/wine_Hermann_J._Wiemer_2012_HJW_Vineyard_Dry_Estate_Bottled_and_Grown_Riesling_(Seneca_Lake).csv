country: US.
description: Gorgeously aromatic with notes of white blossoms and waxy lime and lemon skins, this dry, delicately composed Riesling is a stunner. Tart mango and and tangerine flavors are juicy on the palate, accented with lemon verbena and a lingering waxiness. It finishes remarkably long with a streak of lemon acidity and a zesty astringency. Delicious now for its youth and exuberance, but likely to develop well over through 2021â€“2024..
