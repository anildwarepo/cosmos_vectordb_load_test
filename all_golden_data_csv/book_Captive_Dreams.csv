Description: Sisters Celeste and Corinne Carson, each a best-selling author with her own fantasy-fulfilling hero, get more than they had bargained for when their ""fictional"" heroes--Jarred, a futuristic conqueror, and Mykhayl, a barbarian warrior of the past--worried about being written off, decide to kidnap their authors and imprison them in the seductive worlds that they created in their books.
