Description: This book reveals in detail how Jane Austen's classic novel is transformed into a stunning television drama. Filmed on location at Wiltshire and Derbyshire, 'Pride and Prejudice', with its lavish sets and distinguished cast, was scripted by award-winning dramatist Andrew Davies. Chronicling 18 months of work - from the original concept to the first broadcast - 'The Making of Pride and Prejudice' brings vividly to life the challenges and triumphs involved in every stage of production of this sumptuous television series. Follow a typical day's filming, including the wholesale transformation of Lacock village into Jane Austen's Meryton. Discover how Colin Firth approaches the part of Darcy, how actors' costumes and wigs are designed and how Carl Davis recreates the period music and composes an original score. Piece together the roles of many behind-the-scenes contributors to the series, from researchers and fencing masters to experts in period cookery and gardening..
