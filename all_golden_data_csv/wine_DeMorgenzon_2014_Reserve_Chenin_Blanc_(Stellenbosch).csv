country: South Africa.
description: There's a lovely vibrancy to the nose of this wine, as initial aromas of green melon and lime peel are laced with attractive herbal hits of fynbos and white flowers. The medium-weight palate offers a plush yet balanced feel, with ample acidity to counter the notes of toasted red apple, honeydew and honeycomb. Spicy wood tones dance on the lingering finish. It's delicious now, but should age well through 2021..
