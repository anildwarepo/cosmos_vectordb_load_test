wine_Montes_2006_Alpha_M_Red_(Santa_Cruz),"Unnamed: 0: 8184.
country: Chile.
description: Opens with a sublime bouquet of tobacco, perfume and baked cherry that conveys a sense of elegance. The palate is saturated and full, with integrated tannins and flavors of molasses, licorice and prime black fruits. This is probably a denser, slightly more ripe version of “M” than in past years, evidenced by the licorice, sweetness and coffee on the chewy finish. Drink now and over the next couple of years..
