country: Italy.
description: Be careful when you look for thense wines, the labels at Aschieri are a little confusing;  a small white strip label at thumb level distinguishes the Sorano ordinaire from the special Costa Bricco. The wine, itself, is thick and quite poerful, with very ripe dark fruit, roses and earth flavors. It is beginning to show its age, and did not seem quite as fresh as the Sorano, but it proved to be more intense and extracted..
