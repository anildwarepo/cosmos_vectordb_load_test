title: The Dragon with Many Heads.
text: An envoy of the Porte Sublime,As history says, once on a time,Before th’ imperial German courtDid rather boastfully report,The troops commanded by his master’s firman,As being a stronger army than the German:To which replied a Dutch attendant,“Our prince has more than one dependantWho keeps an army at his own expense.”The Turk, a man of sense,Rejoin’d, “I am awareWhat power your emperor’s servants share.It brings to mind a tale both strange and true,A thing which once, myself, I chanced to view.I saw come darting through a hedge,Which fortified a rocky ledge,A hydra’s hundred heads; and in a triceMy blood was turning into ice.But less the harm than terror,—The body came no nearer;Nor could, unless it had been sunder’d,To parts at least a hundred.While musing deeply on this sight,Another dragon came to light,Whose single head availsTo lead a hundred tails:And, seized with juster fright,I saw him pass the hedge,—Head, body, tails,—a wedgeOf living and resistless powers.—The other was your emperor’s force; this ours.”.
