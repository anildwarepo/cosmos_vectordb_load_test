country: Israel.
description: A blend of 40% each Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, 10% Petit Verdot, 4% Cabernet Franc, and 3% each Mourv√®dre and Grenache, this wine is made from grapes that are dried for 50 days prior to fermentation. The finished wine is aged in barrel for 40 months prior to bottling, yet it is surprisingly soft in the mouth and equal parts smooth and bright. Aromas of raspberry, black plum and maple give way to flavors of strawberry, cranberry sauce, maple-cured meat and rose petal..
