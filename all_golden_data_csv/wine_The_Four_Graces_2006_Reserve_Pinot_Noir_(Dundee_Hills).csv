country: US.
description: Some tasters will celebrate the elegance and finesse of this lightweight Pinot; time will be the ultimate judge. At the moment it is a bit out of balance; there is light cherry fruit, plenty of alcohol, some grainy, earthy tannins and overall a lack of integration. Maybe it just needs more time in the bottle; the components are good enough—tart cranberry and strawberry flavors, sharp acids, some minerality and an earthy underpinning. It just hasn't (yet) come together..
