country: Italy.
description: Combining finesse and structure, this impressive wine opens with fantastic scents of new leather, woodland berry, baking spice and balsamic notes. A blend of Nebbiolo and 15% Vespolina, the enticing palate doles out juicy black cherry, raspberry and white pepper framed in firm refined tannins. An energizing mineral note carries the lingering finish. Despite the warm vintage, it still boasts freshness. Drink through 2026..
