wine_Marqués_de_Murrieta_2008_Capellanía_Viura_(Rioja),"Unnamed: 0: 55360.
country: Spain.
description: There are wines with mass appeal and others that are so idiosyncratic that only one in five people might like it. This falls into the latter category; it's barrel-fermented Viura with Sherry, dry wood, butterscotch and corn cake aromas. The mouth is creamy and resiny, with integrated acidity that keeps it afloat. Flavors of spiced pear, vanilla, cinnamon and toffee suggest amontillado Sherry and something elusive yet refined. Drink now with a rich seafood dish like lobster or baked turbot..
