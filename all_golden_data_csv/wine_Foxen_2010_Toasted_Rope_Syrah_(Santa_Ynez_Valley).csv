country: US.
description: Do not pop the cork and drink this right away as it's currently tight and tannic. But as it warms up and breathes, it releases its considerable charms. With 16% Viognier blended in, it's fantastically rich and concentrated in black-pepper-accented raspberry and sweet-smoke flavors. Acidity adds balance to the richness. You can enjoy this wine now, after an hour in the decanter, or cellar it for at least six years..
