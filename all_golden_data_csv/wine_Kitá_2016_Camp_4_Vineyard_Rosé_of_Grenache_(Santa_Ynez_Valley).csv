country: US.
description: The delicate yet brilliant pink color of this rosé is stunning (Could it be protected by the darker glass, a rare packaging choice for the style?) and the wine inside matches up, starting with a brisk nose of red apple, white cherry, strawberry and lime. There's red plum and more strawberry to the sip. With a grippy texture and steadily rising acidity, this is one of the better pinks of the vintage..
