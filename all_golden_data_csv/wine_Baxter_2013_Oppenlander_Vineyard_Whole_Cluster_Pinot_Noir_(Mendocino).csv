country: US.
description: A wine made like this doesn't come along every day. It was 100% whole-cluster fermented with wild yeast and aged in all neutral barrels. Its rich, soothing and complex personality makes it perfect for a special occasion that involves something like roast quail, sauteed mushrooms or beef bourgignon. It has full body and layered aromas of black tea, ripe plums and cigar box, combined with both fruity and savory flavors and fine tannins..
