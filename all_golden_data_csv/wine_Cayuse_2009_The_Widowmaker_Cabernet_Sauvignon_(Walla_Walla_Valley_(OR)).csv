description: Using grapes sourced entirely from the En Chamberlin Vineyard, this pure Cabernet is deep, dark, focused and tight, with firm but velvety tannins and a perfect mix of cassis, coffee and earth.

Flavors of Serrano ham and other cured meats, plus a delicate saltiness and minerality keep the flavors developing onto  the long, fascinating finish..
