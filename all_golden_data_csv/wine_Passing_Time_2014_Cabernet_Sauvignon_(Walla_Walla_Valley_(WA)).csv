wine_Passing_Time_2014_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Walla_Walla_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 52868.
country: US.
description: This is the inaugural release of this wine, which is composed of fruit from Pepper Bridge and Seven Hills vineyards. It's aromatically generous, with appealing notes of sage, dried herb, cassis, dark chocolate, spice, pencil lead and dark fruit. The palate delivers a mouthful of dark-fruit flavors and tannins that are combined to a fine sheen. It shows a beautiful sense of balance capped off by a persistent finish. It drinks well now but is made with the future in mind..
