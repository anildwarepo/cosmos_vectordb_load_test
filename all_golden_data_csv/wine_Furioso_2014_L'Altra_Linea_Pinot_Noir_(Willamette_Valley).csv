country: US.
description: This is the first release from this new winery, and was crafted by Jared Etzel using Bonnie Jean and Schindler vineyard fruit. It's a lovely mix of blueberry, raspberry and cherry flavors, lively and bright, with polished acidity and 30% new oak just peeking through. Drink it young with a nice chunk of wild salmon, or age it a few years and bring on the lamb chops. Either way, you're in for a treat..
