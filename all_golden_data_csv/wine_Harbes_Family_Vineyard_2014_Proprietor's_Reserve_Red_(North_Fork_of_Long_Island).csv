country: US.
description: A generations-old farming family on the North Fork, Harbes has been producing wines of increasing elegance and consistency in recent vintages. This Merlot-dominated blend of Syrah, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot is especially refined. A subtle sexy wine, it's redolent of ripe sunkissed blackberries spiced with coffee and anise. Full bodied yet tautly structured, it lingers on a crisp cranberry finish marked by feathery tannins..
