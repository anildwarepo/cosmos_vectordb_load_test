country: Austria.
description: A wonderfully subtle but aromatic nose combines appetizing notes of red apple, dried orange peel and a hint of yeast. These flavors combine into the most charming, easy-drinking but textured white wine. This strikes a wonderful balance between an aromatic, almost plump richness of aroma and a sprightly, fresh but concentrated palate. The edges show appetizing white pepper and orange zest. This is highly unusual (this grape represents just 0.4% of Austria's vineyards) but all the more joyous for it..
