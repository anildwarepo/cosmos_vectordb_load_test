country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Andrea Mullineux. Named Trifecta for the three vineyards—one schist-based, one granite-based and one iron-based—the wine is sourced from, this is an expressive and layered Syrah. Initial notes of violet, iris and wild rose give way to fruity tones of wild strawberry, raspberry, game and smoky spice, all grounded by an earthy minerality. The tannins are silky yet structured, with tight berry-skin flavors and a lingering finish reminiscent of mocha and toasted oak. It's a baby now, so try it after 2019 and through 2024..
