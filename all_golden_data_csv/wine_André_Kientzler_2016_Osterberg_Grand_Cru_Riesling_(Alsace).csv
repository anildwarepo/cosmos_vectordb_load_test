country: France.
description: A very tender touch of peach is felt on the nose. On the palate it is bright lemon freshness that takes over. Despite the lemony concentration on the dry taut palate, there is a wonderfully light touch. A zesty edge of pleasantly bitter pith accentuates the citrus freshness perfectly. This is luminous and refreshing, vivid and bright. The finish is totally citrus-focused and lip-smackingly moreish. Drink 2017–2035..
