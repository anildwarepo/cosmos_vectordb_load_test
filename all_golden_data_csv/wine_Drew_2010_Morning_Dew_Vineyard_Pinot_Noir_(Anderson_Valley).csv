country: US.
description: Another great Anderson Valley Pinot from Drew, made using fruit from a vineyard in Philo—the “deep end” or coolest section of the valley. While you won't find obnoxious acidity despite the officially high reading, the wine does have cool-climate notes of mushrooms, pine needles and cola, in addition to classic fruit flavors of raspberries and cherries. It's very fine, dry and complex; enjoy now or cellar for 6–8 years..
