country: France.
description: A touch of flinty reduction clings to the nose but soon relaxes into soft notes of ripe black cherry. The palate is textured and dry, harmonious with fruit and the gentle ripple and crunch of slightly rustic but utterly pleasant tannins. This seems to be its perfect drinking window now: generous with fruit, utterly harmonious and starting to mellow. The finish is fresh, clean and totally moreish. If you can resist at all, this may well continue to develop. Drink now through 2025..
