description: This noted Napa producer has excelled at Petite Sirah for a long time, and with the impressive 2010, they've out-done themselves. The wine comes from a vineyard block, said to be more than 70 years of age, that contains other varieties, such as Carignane, Grenache and Syrah. Thus, it's a field blend of the type that Italian-American vintners produced throughout much of the 20th century. Dry and tannic, with wild berry, currant, licorice, tobacco and oak flavors, the wine is wonderful now, and should develop bottle complexities until 2034..
