wine_Johanneshof_Reinisch_2013_Holzspur_Pinot_Noir_(Thermenregion),"Unnamed: 0: 54300.
country: Austria.
description: A very alluring mix of wintery wood smoke, slight Bourbon vanilla and fallen oak leaves crushed underfoot frames restrained notes of red fruit. There is the most seductive, barely glanced notion of elderberry. The palate is silky and dwells on the autumnal aspects of Pinot but comes with immense elegance, tender white pepper notes and a store of profound fruit. There is a fine-grained density and real structure beneath this smooth surface. Be patient and give this wine its due and drink 2018–2025..
