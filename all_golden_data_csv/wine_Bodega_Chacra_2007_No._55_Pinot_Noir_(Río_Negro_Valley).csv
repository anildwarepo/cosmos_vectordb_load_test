wine_Bodega_Chacra_2007_No._55_Pinot_Noir_(Río_Negro_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 115572.
country: Argentina.
description: From vines planted in 1955, this is a rose-tinted Pinot with a woven, integrated bouquet of toast, mineral and berry fruits. There's more Burgundian character here than New World, so it pours on the cerebral scents and flavors of tea, rose hip, strawberry and raspberry. Reserved in style, but good to drink now and over the next few years. If $100 seems like a lot to spend on Argentinean Pinot, you should try to give this a taste at some point; you may be convinced otherwise..
