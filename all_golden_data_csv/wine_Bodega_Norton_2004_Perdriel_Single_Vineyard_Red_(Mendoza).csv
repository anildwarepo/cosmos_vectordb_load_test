country: Argentina.
description: There's no other way to put it: Perdriel from Norton is one of Argentina's best high-end blends. It's rich and extracted, but still carries that just-right mix of preserving acidity, structured tannins and dynamite fruit. Opens with chocolate and berry marmalade, and then effortlessly transitions to flavors of cassis, blackberry and fudge. Touches of prune, leather and coffee grace the meaty, substantive finish. 500 cases made..
