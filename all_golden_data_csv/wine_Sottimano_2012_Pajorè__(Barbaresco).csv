country: Italy.
description: A classic Nebbiolo fragrance of red rose, perfumed berry, baking spice and a whiff of earth emerges on this stunning wine. Firm, polished tannins weave through the elegantly structured palate, effortlessly supporting juicy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper and star anise while bright acidity keeps it fresh. It's still young and needs to unwind before it can fully develop. Drink 2019–2032..
