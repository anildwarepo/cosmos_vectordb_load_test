country: US.
description: Hews to the Hanzell style, which is almost old-fashioned in this age of ripely opulent Pinot Noirs. This one's tight as a drum in tannins and acids, a quivery, nervously wound wine. Yet it's quite rich and complex, with a tapestry of cherry, red licorice, tobacco, Canadian bacon, dusty Indian spice and buttered toast flavors.  Needs 7â€“8 years in the cellar, and, based on tastings of very old Hanzell, should slowly unfold through the 2020s..
