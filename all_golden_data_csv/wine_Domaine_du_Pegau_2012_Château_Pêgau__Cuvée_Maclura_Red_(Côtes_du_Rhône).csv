country: France.
description: The aromas of cracked peppercorns, iodine, blackberries, crushed stone, dried spices and black olives are practically intoxicating on their own. Then, on the palate, you can taste the intensity, with firm tannins that come from a patch of 50-year-old vines in Sorgues. Drink this blend of 60% Grenache, 25% Syrah, 10% Mourvèdre and 5% Cinsault from 2017–2025, treating it almost as if it were a mini Châteauneuf-du-Pape..
