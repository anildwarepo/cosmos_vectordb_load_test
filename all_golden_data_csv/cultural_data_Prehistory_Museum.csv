Application Description: Available in French and English, this digital mediation device accompanies the visit of the Prehistory Museum of Île-de-France. It is free and can be downloaded directly at the reception hall of the museum.Opened in 1981, the museum presents the Prehistory of Île-de-France, from the first flints hand-carved by Man around 600 000 BC at the end of the Iron Age and at the time of Caesar’s conquest of Gaul.Located in Nemours, in the southern part of the forest of Fontainebleau, the museum was built in undergrowth strewed with sandstone blocks. It is a contemporary building, including six interior gardens, and widely open to surrounding nature. It is listed/classified as a Historic Monument and has obtained the 20th century heritage label.Consequently, this application, which comprises 400 pictures, is composed of two different visits: one dedicated to the archaeological collections, and the other to the architecture of the building. The first one is a commented one hour tour of the museum’s rooms in a chronological order. The second one proposes a 30 minute walk inside and outside the museum.For a more detailed visit of the collections, the application gives the possibility to discover typical objects of the great periods of Prehistory, via index cards.The museum team wishes you an excellent visit.Application developed by smArtappsDevelopment of audio contents: Studio Vert FoncéRead moreCollapse.
