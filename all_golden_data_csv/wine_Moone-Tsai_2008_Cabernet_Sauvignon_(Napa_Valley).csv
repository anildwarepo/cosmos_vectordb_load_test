wine_Moone-Tsai_2008_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Napa_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 83371.
country: US.
description: One sip is all it takes to fall in love with this Cabernet, which contains a little Merlot. It's rich and lush and authoritative on every level. The texture is soft as velvet, but the tannins are firm, backing up blackberry, cherry, chocolate, cassis, mineral and new oak flavors that are complex and linger long into the spicy finish. Such are the tannins that the wine is likely to age well through 2016, at least..
