country: US.
description: This nonvintage blend is labeled by edition, this being the fourth. The mélange includes Syrah, Sangiovese, Montepulciano and a splash of Evolution white for a wine that's totally unique, and totally cool. Ripe raspberry and cherry-candy flavors also carry a note of fresh mushroom. The wine rolls into a darker, black-cherry component as it comes through the back palate. It delivers big flavors at a budget price..
