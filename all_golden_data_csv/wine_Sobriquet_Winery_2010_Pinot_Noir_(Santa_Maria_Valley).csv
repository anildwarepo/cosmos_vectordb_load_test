country: US.
description: While this Pinot is huge in fruit and has a big, heavyweight mouthfeel, somehow it never loses its sense of delicacy and charm. The flavors are the essence of cherries: ripe, sweet and intense. This richness is balanced by the earthiness of a wild mushroom risotto. With brilliant acidity, it's a wonderfully rewarding wine, easily on par with the 2009, perhaps a shade better. The grapes come from the famed Sierra Madre Vineyard..
