country: US.
description: This is Steven Kent's fourth vintage of Lineage, his blockbuster Bordeaux red from carefully tended Livermore fruit. Predominantly Cabernet Sauvignon (65%), it includes 16% Cab Franc, 15% Merlot, 3% Petit Verdot and 2% Malbec. Layered in coffee and herbal cassis, and finely structured, it is an elegant, herbal-kissed, slightly coy wine, enjoyable now with a big meal or ready to sleep in bottle until 2024â€“2029..
