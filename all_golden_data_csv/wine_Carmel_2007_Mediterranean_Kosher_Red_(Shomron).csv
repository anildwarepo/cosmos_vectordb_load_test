country: Israel.
description: An interesting blend of 37% Carignan, 26% Shiraz, 20% Petit Verdot, 15% Petite Sirah and 2% Viognier, this is a delightful red that offers tons of complexity and character. Black plum, cherry and currant fruit flavors are integrated with herbal notes of sandalwood, cigar spice and licorice root. Round and full but structured with gripping tannins and balanced acidity, and everything carrying through the long finish. Drink now through 2014..
