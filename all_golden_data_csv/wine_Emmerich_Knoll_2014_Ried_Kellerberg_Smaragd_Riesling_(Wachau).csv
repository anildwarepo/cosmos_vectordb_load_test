country: Austria.
description: Mandarin peel flirts with the aromatic zest of Seville orange. The concentration of flavor is immense and has the verve, drive and linearity of a jet-engine on on takeoff. The palate slows down the motion and captures the nuanced flavors of Seville orange—tinged green, bitter, juicy and tart at the same time. This will not reach its finish line for years but will provide racy enjoyment all the way. Drink 2018–2030..
