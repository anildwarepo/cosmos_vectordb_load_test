wine_Viader_2008_Red_(Napa_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 122736.
country: US.
description: Shows the luscious fruit and softness of previous vintages, with rich, layered raspberry, cherry, cassis, vanilla, caramelized oak and spice flavors that go on and on into a long finish. The tannins are sturdy from this blend of the two Cabernets, Sauvignon and Franc, which was grown on the lower slopes of Howell Mountain. Yet it's so sweet and fruity, you can drink it now. Misses some of the complexity of the 2007 vintage, but still very fine and polished..
