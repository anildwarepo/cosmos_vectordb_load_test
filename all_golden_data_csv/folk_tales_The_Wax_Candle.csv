title: The Wax Candle.
text: From bowers of gods the bees came down to man.On Mount Hymettus, first, they say,They made their home, and stored awayThe treasures which the zephyrs fan.When men had robb’d these daughters of the sky,And left their palaces of nectar dry,—Or, in English as the thing’s explain’d,When hives were of their honey drain’d—The spoilers ‘gan the wax to handle,And fashion’d from it many a candle.Of these, one, seeing clay, made brick by fire,Remain uninjured by the teeth of time,Was kindled into great desireFor immortality sublime.And so this new EmpedoclesUpon the blazing pile one sees,Self-doom’d by purest follyTo fate so melancholy.The candle lack’d philosophy:All things are made diverse to be.To wander from our destined tracks—There cannot be a vainer wish;But this Empedocles of wax,That melted in chafing-dishWas truly not a greater foolThan he of whom we read at school..
