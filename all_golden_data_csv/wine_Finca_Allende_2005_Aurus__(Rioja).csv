wine_Finca_Allende_2005_Aurus__(Rioja),"Unnamed: 0: 36490.
country: Spain.
description: With the exact same rating as the awesome 2004, this new vintage of Aurus is an unbridled winner. It's a little creamy and sweet on first blush, but time and air reveals its darker, more serious side. Flavors of blackberry, barbecued beef and fudge tell all you need to know about ripeness and richness, and among the new classics of Rioja, Aurus is one of the leaders. Drink now and over the next three years. It's not really for long-term cellaring..
