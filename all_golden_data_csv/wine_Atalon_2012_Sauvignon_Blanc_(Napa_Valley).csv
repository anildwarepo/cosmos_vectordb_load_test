country: US.
description: Dry and crisp with acidity, this Sauvignon Blanc, with 3% SÃ©millon, was fermented in stainless steel but partially aged in neutral oak barrels. The palate shows complex flavors of citrus fruits, Asian pears, lychee, cashews, vanilla, minerals and white pepper, with a touch of honey. The grapes come from all around the valley, including the cooler Oak Knoll district as well as warmer St. Helena. A brilliant example of blending, and easy to find, with 10,000 cases produced..
