country: Germany.
description: Tasted with over a decade of bottle aging, this late-release Spätlese is a heart-stopper. The core of this delicately honeyed wine is still vibrantly fruity, concentrated in luscious yellow peach and cherry flavors. Intonations of maturity show in glimpses of creamy cashew, dried mushroom and crushed rock that extend from nose to finish. It should maintain its spry, electric feel from now through 2021 at least..
