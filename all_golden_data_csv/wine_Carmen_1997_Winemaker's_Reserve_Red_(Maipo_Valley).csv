country: Chile.
description: A blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Grande Vidure, 20% Petite Syrah and 10% Merlot, it is as if you can clearly account for each varietal's contribution. Ripe cassis, cherry, plum, and spice flavors are buttressed by well-integrated oak.  Beautifully balanced, it has good acidity and mature tannins, and closes with a long, satisfying finish. Great wine for tonight's grilled T-bone, and worthy of mid-term cellaring ..
