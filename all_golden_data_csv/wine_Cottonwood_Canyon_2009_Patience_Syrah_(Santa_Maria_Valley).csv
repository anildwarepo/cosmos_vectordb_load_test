country: US.
description: Cottonwood Canyon specializes in Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, but they also have three acres of Syrah in their Santa Maria vineyard. The result in this bottling offers aromas blending red fruit with minty herbs, like a cherry cough drop. The wine is fairly lean on the mouth, representative of a cooler-climate expression of the grape, with oregano, sour cherry, cranberry and chalky minerality. The finish is reminiscent of crème brûlée..
