description: This comes from 30-year-old vines in the Quinta da Manoella, the family vineyard of Jorge Borges, one of the winemaking husband-and-wife team at Wine & Soul. This bottling shows the fruit-driven side of this vineyard, which also has 100-year-old vines. It's dense and solid, with powerful tannins that are beautifully integrated into the big plum fruits.
