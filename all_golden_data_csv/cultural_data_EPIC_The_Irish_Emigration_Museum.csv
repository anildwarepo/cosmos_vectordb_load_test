First Page Reviews: Outstanding, It is a must in Dublin A great museum that is very original in it's interactive exhibits and well  worth an entry. It takes about 90 minutes to pass through and this app  replaces the audio guide that you can rent at the museum. It basically only  does that though and hopefully they will find more useful things to do with...Full Review A great museum that is very original in it's interactive exhibits and well  worth an entry. It takes about 90 minutes to pass through and this app  replaces the audio guide that you can rent at the museum. It basically only  does that though and hopefully they will find more useful things to do with  the app, but for now as an audio guide it works well..
