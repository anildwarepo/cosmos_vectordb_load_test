country: US.
description: Tannic and closed now, this wine has a tough-as-nails astringency that brings to mind an older style of Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon, one that required many years of aging. However, this wine is considerably riper and fruitier than anything the mountain used to yield, testimony to modern growing and extractive measures. It is, in a word, delicious, with deep, long blackberry, black currant, cr√®me de cassis and smoke flavors. But, like the 2007, it needs serious time in the cellar. Try after 2018..
