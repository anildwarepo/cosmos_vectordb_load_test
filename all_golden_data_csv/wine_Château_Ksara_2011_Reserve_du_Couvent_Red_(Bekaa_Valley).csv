description: Dark garnet in the glass, this blend of 40% Syrah, 30% Cabernet Franc and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon offers aromas of wild raspberry, brambles and geranium leaf. It offers a good balance of tannins and acidity as well as fruit and spice flavors featuring blackberry, black cherry, chocolate, coffee, fennel bulb and black pepper. Mouth-coating tannins do not overpower, but continue well into the bright, lasting finish..
