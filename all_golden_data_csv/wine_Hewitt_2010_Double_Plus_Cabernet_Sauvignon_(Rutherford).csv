country: US.
description: This wine has so much new French oak that the toast and caramel become integral parts of the flavor profile. Why would you do that with great fruit? It just buries it. And the fruit of this wine is indeed rich in blackberries, currants, blueberries and licorice. This wine will dazzle fans of oak, but true enthusiasts should draw the line and signal the winery that oak is a seasoning, not the main ingredient..
