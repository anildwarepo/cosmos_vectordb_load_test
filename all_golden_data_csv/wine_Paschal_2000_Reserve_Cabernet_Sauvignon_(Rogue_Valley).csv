country: US.
description: This might be one of Oregon's best Cabernet efforts to date. Yes, it's firm, with hard tannins, but time should allow that to settle down. In the meantime, there's char, road tar and caramel on the nose, while plum, cassis and chocolate dominate the rich, extracted palate. Toward the end it's the tannic structure that makes itself most felt. But again, some time in the cellar is probably all it requires..
