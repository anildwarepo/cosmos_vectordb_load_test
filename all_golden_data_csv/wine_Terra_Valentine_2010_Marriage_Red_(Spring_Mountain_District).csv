country: US.
description: The 2010 vintage was a generally good one for the winery. Most of the Cabs were released last year, but they've held this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend back for extra time in the bottle. Yet it's still very tannic, stinging the gums with astringency. Underneath that is a beautiful wine, brimming with fresh blackberries and cassis, and an attractive green-olive note that's sweet and salty and umami-rich. Already throwing some sediment, this is a serious cellar candidate. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2018..
