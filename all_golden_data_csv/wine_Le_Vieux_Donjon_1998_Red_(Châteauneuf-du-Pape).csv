wine_Le_Vieux_Donjon_1998_Red_(Châteauneuf-du-Pape),"Unnamed: 0: 73873.
country: France.
description: Inky and rustic, yet in a refined manner. This is knock-out juice if you like ’em big and flavorful. The full bouquet of grape, raisin, oak, licorice and herb aromas pulls you in and the follow-up palate of dense blackberry flavors with herb and smoke shadings fulfills the promise the nose makes. Loads of oak here, but there’s great depth of fruit for it to play against. A definite keeper; hold for three or four years at least..
