country: US.
description: There's a fine wine hiding inside this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend, which contains Cabernet Franc and Merlot. But its qualities are buried beneath strong tannins. The fruit is impossibly young, all jammy cherries and blackberries, and new oak sticks out in the form of buttered toast. It's all very imposing, so don't even think about drinking it anytime soon. Should begin to blossom around 2018, and will be going strong for another decade..
