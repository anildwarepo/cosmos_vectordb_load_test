country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Andries Burger. An attractive and varietally correct Pinot, this leads with aromas of ripe red cherry, currant and strawberry fruits, all laced with hints of bittersweet cocoa, cola spice and sous bois. Silky in texture, with smooth tannins and ample acidity to keep the red fruit flavors fresh and lively on the palate. The finish transitions from just-ripe cherry to sweet spice and finally forest floor, with just a hint of savory mushroom on the very end. Drinkable now, but this will cellar well through 2023..
