title: The Ass.
text: It is related that when the Lord created the world, he also made all the animals, and gave each its name. He also created the ass, which said: “Lord, what is my name?” “Your name is ass!” The ass went away well pleased. After a while it forgot its name, and went back to the Lord. “Lord, what is my name?” “Ass!” After a while it came back again. “Excuse me, Lord, what is my name?” “Ass, ass!” The ass turned and went away, but forgot it another time, and came back. “Lord, I have forgotten my name.” The Lord could not stand it any longer, but seized its ears and pulled them sharply, exclaiming: “Ass! Ass! Ass!” The ears were pulled so hard that they became long, and that is why the ass has long ears, and why we pull a person’s ears to keep him from forgetting a thing..
