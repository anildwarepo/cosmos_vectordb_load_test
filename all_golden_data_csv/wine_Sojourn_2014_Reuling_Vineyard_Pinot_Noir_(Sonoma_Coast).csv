country: US.
description: From a tiny spot near the town of Forestville, this vineyard-designate does justice to the special site, planted in Goldridge dirt to a variety of suitcase clones. Earth, sage and a persistence of exotic spice mark it first, inviting one in for further exploration of raspberry, cherry and a firmness of tannin. Concentrated, it's enjoyable now and yet should have years more to go in the bottle. Drink now through 2024..
