country: US.
description: MacPhail has shown steady improvement working with this vineyard, which seems to require a cool year like 2009 to succeed. The wine is quite light in body and color, but the flavors really penetrate and sink in deep. They range from red cherries and cola to red licorice, bacon and spices, with a deft touch of oak. Dry and crisp in acidity, it should provide fascinating drinking over the next seven years..
