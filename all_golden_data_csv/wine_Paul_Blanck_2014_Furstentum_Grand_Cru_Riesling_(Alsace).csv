country: France.
description: Tender notes of lemon and glorious freshness are first apparent on the shy nose but achieve their full expression on the slender, dry and incisive palate. The purity of the lemon zest notes tingles on the tongue and creates a streamlined, refreshing dynamic. This is clean and invigorating with its uncompromising bright freshness that lasts and lasts. This is lovely now but has huge promise. Drink 2017–2037..
