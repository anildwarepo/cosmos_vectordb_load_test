country: US.
description: This estate red is named after its mountainous locale—a brambly vineyard on Pritchard Hill above Oakville. It combines quite ripe Cabernet Sauvignon with 15% Cabernet Franc, 15% Petit Verdot and 5% Merlot, projecting power and prestige with perfumed violet, dark cherry and savory leather and tobacco notes. Soft, pliable tannins add weight and texture. More time in bottle should add nuance; enjoy 2024–2034..
