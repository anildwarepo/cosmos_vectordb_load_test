country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Sebastian Beaumont. It's hard not to like this wine. Initial aromas of clean yet ripe melon, yellow apple, sweet citrus and peach tones are upfront on the nose and carry through to the satisfying palate. The sweetness is countered by great acidic lift, with a saline minerality that lingers on the long, mouthwatering finish. It's hard to resist now, but it should continue to age well through 2022, and likely even beyond..
