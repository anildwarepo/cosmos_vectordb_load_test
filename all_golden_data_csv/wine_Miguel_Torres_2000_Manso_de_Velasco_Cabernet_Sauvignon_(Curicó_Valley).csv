wine_Miguel_Torres_2000_Manso_de_Velasco_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Curicó_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 124345.
country: Chile.
description: This structured, old-vine Cabernet is always a leader among the Chilean pack, and the current version is typical in that it's built like a house, with cool, concentrated aromas of blackberry, cassis, earth and black olive. Cola notes on the palate frame cherry and cassis flavors, while the finish is firm yet rewardingly luscious, with ample depth. Very solid and tasty, and packed deep with power. Can be drunk immediately..
