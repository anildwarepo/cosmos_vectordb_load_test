description: The 2006 vintage was erratic, but Nick Goldschmidt has pulled a rabbit out of a hat with this fabulously complex and rewarding 100% Cabernet. It's classic Oakville, dry, tannic and elegant, and the way the blackberry and black currant flavors marry the new oak is simply wonderful. The Game Ranch Vineyard has been source to some of Goldschmidt's greatest Cabernets over the past decade. This is one of those wines that's compelling to drink now, but should evolve over the next 10â€“15 years..
