country: France.
description: A wonderfully tender hint of Damask rose swirls into the nose, followed by a smoky, grounding earthiness. The palate plays with that rose flavor and adds a touch of peach and tangy citrus zest. The palate stays on the off-dry site and focuses on zesty spice and a wonderfully textured phenolic edge. It masters a wonderful high-wire act between richness and zesty vigor. The wine is beautiful, full-flavored and exciting with a long just-off-dry finish. Drink 2017–2027..
