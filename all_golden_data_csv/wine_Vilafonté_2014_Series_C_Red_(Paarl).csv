country: South Africa.
description: At present, the wood dominates the nose and mouth of this lush, creamy wine. It's brimming with notes of cedar, sweet spice and bittersweet cocoa powder that ride atop the baked cherry and raspberry fruit. The mouthfeel is smooth and plush, with velvety tannins and lingering dry, spicy notes that grace the finish. An infant now, give it some time to further harmonize and the oak to integrate; try after 2019..
