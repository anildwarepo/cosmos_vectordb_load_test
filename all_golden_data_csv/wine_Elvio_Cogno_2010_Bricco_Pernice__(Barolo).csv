country: Italy.
description: Radiant and structured, this is initially closed but slowly opens to reveal engaging aromas of woodland berry, violet, star anise, dark cooking spice and a balsamic note. The vibrant, full-bodied palate boasts great energy while offering layers of wild cherry, raspberry, white pepper and licorice. Bright acidity and firm, polished tannins provide balance. Give it time to fully develop. Drink between 2020 and 2035..
