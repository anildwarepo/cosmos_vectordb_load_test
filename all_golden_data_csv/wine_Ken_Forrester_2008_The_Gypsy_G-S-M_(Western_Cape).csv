country: South Africa.
description: Fleshy fruit tones of cherry, plum, blackberry and raspberry all abound on the nose of this G-S-M blend, alongside secondary hints of black pepper and cured meat. There's a nice evolution to the medium-weight palate, which starts off with fruity dominance but then transitions to spice, followed by sweet smoke and finally ends of a decadent mocha flavor. It's firmly textured with gripping tannins and a long finish..
