country: Germany.
description: The 2014 vintage produced so many standouts for St. Urbans-Hof, it's hard to decide on favorites, but this luminous Spätlese pulls quite a bit of weight for its dimunitive price tag. While delicate in frame, it's dramatic in composure, shifting from floral fruity exuberance to waxy, mineral and taut in each sip. It's drinking gorgeously now but should hold well, and perhaps improve, through at least 2020..
