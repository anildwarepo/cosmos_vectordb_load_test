country: Italy.
description: Made in amphorae made from Georgian clay, this “Classica” expression of the Vitovska grape opens with a intense copper-ornage color and deeply nutty nuances of pine nut and almond backed by honey, butterscotch and candied fruit (there's not much in the way of fresh fruit here). Thanks to its inherent tannic structure, the wine drinks more like a red than a white. It will be fascinating to watch it age ten more years..
