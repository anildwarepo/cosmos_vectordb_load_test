Description: Love is always just around the corner in a Jill Mansell novel - with a few surprises and a lot of humour on the way to happiness Maddy Harvey was a bit of an ugly duckling as a teenager, what with her NHS specs, unfortunate hair and wonky teeth. Thankfully she's blossomed since then. But when she meets Kerr McKinnon one starry summer's night and discovers, days later, who he actually is... well, that's when the problems really start. Because everyone in Ashcombe knows what happened eleven years ago, and as far as her mother's concerned, Marcella would rather tear that family to pieces with her bare hands than see Maddy associate with a McKinnon. It's Romeo and Juliet all over again. Quick, hide those sharp knives and that little bottle of poison....
