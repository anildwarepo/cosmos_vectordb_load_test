country: US.
description: This is the costliest of Stolpman's new reds and easily the best. It impresses for the depth of flavor and classic, dense structure. A co-fermented blend of Sangiovese and Syrah, it shows imposingly complex layers of dark stone fruits and berries, dark chocolate, bacon, dusty Indian spices and sweet, smoky sandalwood, wrapped into powerfully rich but gently ground tannins. Very fine, approaching the profound. Nowâ€“2013 before it loses freshness..
