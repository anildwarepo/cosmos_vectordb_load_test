country: US.
description: The Maritime bottling traditionally has represented some of the highest expressions of W.H. Smith's various Pinot Noirs. Gentle and yet complex, it opens with notes of raspberries and cherries accented with mushrooms and minerals. There's a deep, brooding earthiness, along with all sorts of spiced orange-rind and sandalwood notes. A great effort, and one of the best Pinots of the vintage. Drink now through 2020..
