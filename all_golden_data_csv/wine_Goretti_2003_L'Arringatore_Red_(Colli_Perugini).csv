country: Italy.
description: L'Arringatore is a 60-30-10 blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Ciliegiolo that boasts a clean modern approach and expert fruit extraction. The nose is sweet-smelling with cherry, almond, blueberry, chocolate and spice and the wine offers a pleasantly approachable intensity of aromas. It's big and brooding in the mouth with plush tannins and noticeable oak-driven flavors on its beautiful, long-lasting finish..
