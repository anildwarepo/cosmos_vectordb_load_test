wine_Guastaferro_2008_Primum__(Taurasi),"Unnamed: 0: 102814.
country: Italy.
description: From one of Taurasi's rising stars, this gorgeous wine opens with enticing scents of underbrush, just-picked violet, dark berry and a whiff of cake spice. The balanced, full-bodied palate delivers layers of mature black cherry, raspberry, cinnamon, carob and cocoa while firm but refined tannins and fresh acidity provide an elegant, age-worthy structure. It's already tempting but hold for more complexity. Drink 2018–2033..
