country: New Zealand.
description: It's taken some time for many of Marlborough's 2012 Pinot Noirs (the product of a cool season) to come around, but this is one that's worth the wait. It's evolved into something quite round and soft, with a long, silky finish. Yet it's not a fruit-forward wine by any stretch, showing more earth, soy and mushroom notes and just enough plum and black cherry fruit to carry those savory complexities. Drink nowâ€“2020..
