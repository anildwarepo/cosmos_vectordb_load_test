country: US.
description: Though Adelsheim offers a large assortment of single-vineyard Pinots, this is the first they've made from Zenith. It surely won't be the last. Concentrated, thick black raspberry and black cherry fruit centers a substantial wine, laced with vivid streaks of vanilla, tobacco and spice. The immediate impact of the fruit is amplified by the density on the palate, and the finish, loaded with baking spices, reflects the aging in one-third new French oak barrels..
