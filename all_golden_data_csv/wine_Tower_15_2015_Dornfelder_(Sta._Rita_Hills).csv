country: US.
description: The Huber Vineyard is one of the few places where this grape grows in America, and the wine is always fascinating. Extremely dark in color, it offers unctuous black currant, graphite and licorice aromas. The palate combines mouth-coating tannins with a surprisingly light, acid-driven frame, showing woody elderberry flavors and the grape's telltale minty lift. Not extremely complex, but a fun and different sipper..
