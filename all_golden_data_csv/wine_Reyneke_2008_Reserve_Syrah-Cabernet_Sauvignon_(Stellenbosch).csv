country: South Africa.
description: This Shiraz-based blend, with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, is bold and layered, taking time to unfold and develop in the glass. Blackberry, currant and wild raspberry notes lead the bouquet, but additional accents of game and herbs unfold and mount in intensity. Flavors of red cherry and currant fill the palate, with hints of fynbos, cocoa and licorice stick staying well into the long finish. Firmly structured, with gripping tannins and concentrated flavors..
