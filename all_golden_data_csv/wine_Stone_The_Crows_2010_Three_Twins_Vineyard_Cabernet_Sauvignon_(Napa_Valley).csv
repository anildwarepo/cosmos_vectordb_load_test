description: The latest entrant into the Napa Cabernet sweepstakes succeeds with this flashy wine. Made from grapes grown in the warm Vaca Hills east of the Silverado Trail, this wine impresses immediately with aromatics of black currants, mocha and lightly toasted French oak. In the mouth, it's pure Cabernet pleasure, with soft, compelling tannins and fine acidity. It's a dramatic wine that should develop well over the next 10 years, if not longer. This is a winery to watch..
