wine_Chateau_Margene_2010_Beau_Mélange_Red_(Paso_Robles),"Unnamed: 0: 15795.
country: US.
description: This blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 25% Cabernet Franc is the Creston winery's top-end offering, and it's beautiful. Aromas of blueberry, black cherry, turned earth and roasted vanilla bean meet with violet and sweet rose florals that keep you sniffing. It's dense on the palate but not overly ripe, with black-rock minerality and leather laid across blueberries and prime rib elements. The tannins are present but not in the way at all..
