country: Italy.
description: Rose, iris, wild berry and baking spice aromas merge with scents of new leather and a balsamic menthol note on this stunning and classically crafted Barolo. The structured, polished palate delivers juicy Marasca cherry, crushed raspberry, pipe tobacco and licorice framed in tightly knit noble tannins and bright acidity. It's going to just keep getting better and better over the next few decades. Drink from 2023 through 2053..
