country: US.
description: The first Syrah in an expanding lineup of Tranche estate wines from the Blue Mountain Vineyard, this exceptional effort hews to a European style despite its substantial alcohol. Initially dark and smoky, hinting at streaks of herb and showing compact berry fruit flavors, it broadens out and expands aromatically, weaving in highlights of cured meats, bacon and clean earth. Just a dollop of herb and stem adds further interest, in a wine that retains its elegance along with exceptional power..
