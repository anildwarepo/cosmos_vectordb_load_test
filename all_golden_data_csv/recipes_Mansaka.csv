Ingredients:.
- 1 tablespoon shortening.
- 1.5 pounds ground beef.
- 2 cups sliced onion.
- 1 clove garlic, minced.

- 0.25 teaspoon ground black pepper.
- 1 teaspoon sugar.

Instructions:.
- Melt the shortening in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef, and cook, stirring to crumble, until evenly browned. Mix in the onion and garlic; cook until tender. Drain excess grease, and sprinkle in the flour, salt, pepper, sugar, basil, cinnamon and oregano. Stir in the mushrooms and tomato sauce, and simmer for 15 minutes over low heat..
- Meanwhile, place the potatoes in a microwave-safe bowl or dish, and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until about halfway done..
