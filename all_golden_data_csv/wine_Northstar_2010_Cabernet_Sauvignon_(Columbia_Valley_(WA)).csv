wine_Northstar_2010_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 78221.
country: US.
description: Consumers may find it difficult to differentiate this from the 2010 Ste. Michelle version of the same wine—both are 100% Cold Creek vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon. But this one, bottled under the Northstar label, has more muscle, more power and more depth. Tannic, thick and darkly fruited, it's a tightly-wound yet expressive effort, with complex flavors that move from black cherry and cassis into fig, tar, tobacco, espresso, dark chocolate and smoke..
