country: US.
description: So rich, ripe and succulent, you can hardly keep from drinking it now. But don't. This is one for the cellar. The alcohol is a refreshingly balanced. The wine is already throwing some sediment, and more than four years of bottle age are mellowing the wine's edges, with the primary blackberry and cherry flavors developing secondary characteristics. Should begin to peak around 2016 and drink well for another decade..
