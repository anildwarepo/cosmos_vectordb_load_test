country: US.
description: Elegant and nuanced, this penetrating Cabernet Franc offers bold strokes of blackberry and plum tinged with hints of wet soil, crushed mineral and spice. It's bold and lusciously composed but there's a puckery-fresh brightness of acidity that's delightful. Released with extended cellar aging, its soft, feathery tannins are approachable already but it's still structured enough to improve well through 2025..
