country: US.
description: Returning to traditional fruit sources (Seven Hills and Pepper Bridge) after the freeze year of 2004, winemaker JF Pellet has crafted the finest Pepper Bridge Cabernet to date. Gorgeous aromas explode from the glass, a lush mix of flower, berry, mocha and sweet earth. Smooth and silky on the tongue, it's a riot of berry and cassis flavor, all in proportion and moving gracefully across the palate and into a round, detailed finish with whiffs of smoke, caramel and coffee grounds..
