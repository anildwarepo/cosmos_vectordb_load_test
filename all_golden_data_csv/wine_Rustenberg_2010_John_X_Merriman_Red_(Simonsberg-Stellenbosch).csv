country: South Africa.
description: Rustenberg's Bordeaux-style blend, made with 48% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Merlot, 4% Petit Verdot, 2% Malbec and 1% Cabernet Franc, is a complex and layered wine, with waves of black fruit and earthy spice that dance endlessly on the nose and mouth. Heady notes of blackberry, boysenberry, cassis and fig are spiced by accents of cocoa, tobacco and sweet, charred wood. It's balanced and well structured, with a velvety texture and a peppery finish.
