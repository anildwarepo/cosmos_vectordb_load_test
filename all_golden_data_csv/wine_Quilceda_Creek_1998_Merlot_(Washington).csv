wine_Quilceda_Creek_1998_Merlot_(Washington),"Unnamed: 0: 37888.
country: US.
description: This extremely limited-production Merlot (about 250 cases) is Alex and Paul Golitzin's “other” great red. It's all Klipsun Vineyard fruit, 75% Merlot and 25% Cabernet, and its soft, chocolatey tannins envelope the taste buds in a sensual, textured landscape comprised of luscious cherry fruit and laced with hints of anise and roasted coffee. Big and extracted, yet more approachable than the Cabernet..
