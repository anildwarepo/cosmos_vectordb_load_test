country: US.
description: Ross Mickel (Ross Andrew Winery) made this Côtes du Rhône-style blend, a flashy riot of floral scents and earthy, funky fruit. Even with several hours breathing time it feels tight—decanting is mandatory. But give it a few years in the cellar and it will unpack even more layers of flavor. Dry and astringent in the mouth, it brings young flavors of cranberry juice and grape concentrate, plenty of acidity and minerality, and excellent depth..
