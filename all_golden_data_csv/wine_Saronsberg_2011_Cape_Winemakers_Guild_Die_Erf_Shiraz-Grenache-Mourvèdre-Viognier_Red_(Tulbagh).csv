country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Dewaldt Heyns. This Shiraz-dominant blend, with 18% Grenache, 9% Mourvèdre and 2% Viognier, is spicy, structured and powerful. Intense notes of cigar box, leather, cured meat, licorice and anise frame the tight black-fruit core. Dense black berry, cherry and currant flavors unfold on the right, gripping palate, with a firm, spicy finish that lingers long. Despite its age, it comes from one of the best vintages in South Africa, and it has the stuffing to continue to age well through 2022..
