country: Italy.
description: Made from organically farmed grapes, this delicious 100% Sangiovese launches with an intense fragrance of wild cherry accompanied by whiffs of Mediterranean herbs and aromas that recall meat juices. The succulent black cherry flavors are accented with notes of white pepper, cinnamon and clove alongside polished tannins. It's well-balanced and surprisingly fresh for the vintage.
