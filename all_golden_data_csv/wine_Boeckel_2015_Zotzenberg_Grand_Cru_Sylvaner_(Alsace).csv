country: France.
description: Shy but very pure notes of ripe juicy pear and fresh ripe mirabelle plum appear on the nose. They continue seamlessly on the full-bodied palate where they find a fitting counterpoint in its phenolic texture, which has a pleasantly bitter edge. This is bone dry but unusually full-bodied for a Sylvaner, highlighting the ripeness of the 2015 vintage. The finish is long and underlines the quiet power of this wine..
