country: US.
description: From the vineyard that helped propel the appellation's reputation into the stratosphere, this wine delivers both in terms of its historical significance, but also in present-day refinement and complexity. A flinty, earthy layer of black truffle and coffee open the aromatic profile of the wine before offering bold, brawny flavors of leather and black currant. The oak is well integrated and the tannins sizable yet behaved. This is a beautiful wine..
