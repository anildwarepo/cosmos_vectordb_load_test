wine_Aresti_2001_Family_Selection_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Curicó_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 30002.
country: Chile.
description: Lightly herbal aromas of black currant, tobacco, minerals and latent char provide for a fine opening. Given that this is now 14+ years old, its core structure and acidity level are excellent. Rooty flavors of licorice and black currant show toast and chocolate accents, while the finish is dry, spicy and whole. This is living proof that top Chilean Cabernets from exceptional vintages can age for up to two decades; drink through 2020..
