country: Austria.
description: Distinct botrytis notes of dried apricot and musk for now dominate the nose while the primary fruit still sleeps in this dry, still-closed wine. The palate is sleek and flowing, while the backbone of acidity sits upright and straight. This uncompromisingly dry wine will not reveal its true colors until at least 2017. Hold onto it until it can shine with subtly spiced, delicate dishes. The length it already possesses promises a great future..
