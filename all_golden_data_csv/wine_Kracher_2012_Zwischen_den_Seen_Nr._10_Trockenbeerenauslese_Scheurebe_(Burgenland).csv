country: Austria.
description: The term “heady” surely was coined just for a wine like this—immensely rich but traveling on very light feet, concentrating the perfumed aromatics of Scheurebe on the palate while exuberantly vaporizing them on the nose. The honeyed blossoms of nettle come to mind as well as summer sprays of honeysuckle. The palate is ultrasweet, evoking tropical largesse of pineapple and passion fruit, always luminous, always bright. This is dessert in itself and shines with immense purity..
