country: US.
description: Fermented in a mix of stainless steel barrels and neutral oak barrels, this was fermented with native yeast and given sur lie aging. It went through 100% malolactic fermentation, which has softened the mid-palate, a mix of lemon, grapefruit and Satsuma orange. There are still traces of phenolic bite, but those citrus rind flavors have been well rounded also, though this carries some heat in the finish..
