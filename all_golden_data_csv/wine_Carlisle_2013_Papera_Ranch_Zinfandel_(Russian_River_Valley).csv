country: US.
description: Wow. This is an incredible wine, as always, but particularly soft and structured in this fine vintage, which deftly marries pretty aromatics and zippy acidity with darker, stormier elements of ripe fig and wood smoke. There's so much complexity and life going on, it'll be hard to wait on this one, though more time in the bottle should make everything that much more settled and complete. Drink now through 2023..
