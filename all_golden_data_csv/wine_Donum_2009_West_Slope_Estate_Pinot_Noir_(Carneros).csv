country: US.
description: A fabulous Pinot Noir that's rich and deeply flavored, with the most wonderful structure. After a fruity, spicy entry, the wine sinks down dramatically on the midpalate, offering masses of cherries, raspberries, red currants, cured meats, saut√©ed mushrooms, spices and sweetly toasted sandalwood. Bone dry, and capable of aging eight years in the cellar, it surpasses even the 2007 West Slope, arguably making it one of the greatest Carneros Pinot Noirs ever made..
