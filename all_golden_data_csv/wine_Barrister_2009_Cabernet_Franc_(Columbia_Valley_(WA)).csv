country: US.
description: The fruit for this excellent Cabernet Franc is sourced from wide-ranging vineyards throughout the Yakima, Columbia and Walla Walla valleys. Aged 18 months in a mix of French, American and Hungarian oak, it is the most accessible of the new red wine releases from Barrister. The tart red fruits are coated with creamy caramel and pretty toast notes, and it sails like clean silk into a long, smooth, buttery finish..
