country: US.
description: This shows Merry Edwards' signature of exceptional deliciousness and drinkability, coupled with seemingly neverending depth. Made using fruit sourced from the winery's vineyard in the cooler southwestern part of the valley, near Sebastopol, this is rich in acids and soft tannins, but the flavors set it apart. Notes of raspberry, cherry, cola, tea, licorice, pepper and sandalwood abound and evolve with every sip. Drink nowâ€“2018..
