country: US.
description: You have to have a great deal of faith to buy this wine, because right now it's almost undrinkable due to the tannins. They're as hard and firm as a brick wall, and whatever fruit there is, and there's plenty, is effectively hidden from the palate's pleasure. Discerning tasters will detect massive blackberries and black currants, buried deep down like pirate's treasure. It should develop quite well over the next ten or fifteen years..
