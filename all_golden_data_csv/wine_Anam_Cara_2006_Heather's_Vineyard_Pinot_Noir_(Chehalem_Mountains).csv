country: US.
description: Planted to a single Dijon clone (114), this single block of Pinot Noir from the estate vineyard expresses its individuality with precision and spot-on balance. Barrel toast meets buttery berries, and the 15% alcohol shows no trace of heat or burn. Rather, it suggests an increasingly rare honesty and lack of manipulation; this is what it takes to ripen these grapes. Many people would love to see that number come down, but the flavors are there, the balance is there, and most importantly, the elegance is (still) there..
