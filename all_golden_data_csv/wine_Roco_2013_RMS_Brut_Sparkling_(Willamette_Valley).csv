country: US.
description: This ambitious debut from Argyle's founding winemaker is the first sparkling wine to be released under his own Roco label. Rollin Michael Soles crafted this classic blend of two-thirds Pinot Noir and one third Chardonnay from three Willamette Valley vineyards. It's a young, tart wine that's still a bit leesy, with precisely defined apple and citrus fruit. Retasted after being open for 24 hours it had just begun to expand and reveal the promise locked away in the bottle. Drink 2020–2030..
