country: Israel.
description: Forest, Yatir's top-of-the-line offering, is always a dense and powerful wine that can age. Right now, the wine smells young and a bit closed, hiding some of its beauty and nuance behind the upfront black plum, cassis and cherry fruit aromas. Hints of fruitcake spice, bramble, cigar box and leather occasionally flicker in the background, revealing what time has in store for this dark beauty of a wine. Big and rich right now, with a full structure and gripping tannins. Drink 2016â€“2022..
