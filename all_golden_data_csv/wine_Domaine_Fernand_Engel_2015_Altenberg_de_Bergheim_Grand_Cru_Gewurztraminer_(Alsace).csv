country: France.
description: A lovely, heady lift of lemon, peach and passion fruit dances on the nose. This rich sweet-fruited tropicality is played out fully on the medium-sweet palate where the passion fruit swirls tartly alongside sweet ripe generous peach. It is the passion-fruit aroma and tartness that gives this a real edge. This not only has sweetness but a real tropical thrill. It's a very concentrated, pure-fruited wine with lots of promise. Drink 2017–2027..
