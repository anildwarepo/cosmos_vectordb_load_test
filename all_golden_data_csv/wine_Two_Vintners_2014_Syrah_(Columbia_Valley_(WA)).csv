country: US.
description: This is a true pan-Washington Syrah, with fruit coming from Discovery, Olsen, Stone Tree, Pepper Bridge, Dineen, Stoney Vine, Yellow Jacket and Boushey vineyardsâ€”all top sites rarely seen in a bottle at this price. Scents of smoke, blue and black fruit, crushed flowers, sagebrush and herb leap out of the glass, demonstrating a lot of aromatic complexity. The palate shows intensity, purity and layering..
