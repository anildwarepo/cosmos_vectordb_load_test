First Page Reviews: Loved it. The others I tried I deleted right away but I'm going to keep this one. The only thing that MIGHT improve it is giving a verbal tour but I love it the way it is. Easy to maneuver and easy to understand. all is lock and you need to pay. to make this better has only the pay version. other options better in the store RESPONSE TO DEVELOPERS: in the map only level one have around 20 rooms free al the other the upgrade message. are you joking? Painful to hear Just a few information here. Always forces you to buy full version.
