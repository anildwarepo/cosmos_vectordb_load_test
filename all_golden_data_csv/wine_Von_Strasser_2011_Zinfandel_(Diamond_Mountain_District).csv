country: US.
description: An amazing Zin that dazzles for the sheer wealth and depth of fruits and spices. Intensely concentrated black currants, cured tobacco, grilled bacon, black pepper and mu shu plum sauce flavors flood the mouth, leading to a long, distinguished finish. The alcohol is refreshingly modest, lending the wine a delicacy rare in California Zinfandel. It will age until at least 2024 but is fine to drink right away..
