country: South Africa.
description: From small-batch, handcraft producer Stark-Condé, this unfiltered Cab offers personality and elegance. Berry, herbs, fennel and spice on the nose lead into a red that's extremely pretty in the mouth. Good integration of tannins and fruit, and a light minerality throughout give the wine a soft, balanced appeal. Though it will pair well with spiced meat and bolder dishes, the wine is great on its own..
