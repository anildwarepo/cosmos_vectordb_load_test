country: US.
description: Veteran winemaker John Abbott (Chalone, Canoe Ridge, Abeja) jumps back on the Pinot Noir wagon with this new project. This is the second vintage for his Freedom Hill designate, a vintage that was notoriously difficult due to monsoon-like rains mid-harvest. Abbott cajoles the grapes into an elegant, refined expression of high-acid Pinot Noir. Slightly saline, with mountain strawberry fruit and autumnal (forest floor) accents, this is lean but polished, and should cellar well now through 2022..
