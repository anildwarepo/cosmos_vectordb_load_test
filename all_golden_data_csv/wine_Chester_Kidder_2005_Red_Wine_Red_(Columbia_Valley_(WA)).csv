wine_Chester_Kidder_2005_Red_Wine_Red_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 50628.
country: US.
description: The blend is 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Syrah and 5% Merlot; the fruit is sourced from vineyards scattered throughout eastern Washington. Velvety and supple, this is a modulated mix of bright, sassy blackberry and currant fruit, spiced up with the peppery highlights of Syrah. The effect is to move it solidly into the Australian camp, which makes perfect sense, for nowhere else in the New World do these two grapes sync up so well. Vanilla and espresso streaks enhance the finish..
