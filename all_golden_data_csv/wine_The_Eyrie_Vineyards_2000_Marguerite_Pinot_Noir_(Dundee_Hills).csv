country: US.
description: This exceptional wine was made by the late David Lett to celebrate the birth of his granddaughter. It's drinking beautifully, and has the color and scent of a mature wine, though Eyrie Pinots can often live longer than those who bet against them. Delicate and subtle, it nonetheless shows surpassing power and length. Mature, fully-evolved dried fruit and herb flavors are highlighted with notes of cinnamon and brown sugar..
