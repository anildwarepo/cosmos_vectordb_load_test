country: Italy.
description: The legend behind Pàtrimo is that the folks at Feudi di San Gregorio had misidentified the grape variety planted in their historic vineyard until it was finally confirmed to be Merlot. Very few vineyards with international varieties exist in this part of the world. This is a beautifully elegant but large expression with precise aromas of blackberry, spice, chocolate and maraschino cherry. The gorgeous 2007 vintage shows tannins that could still age in the cellar and a slightly sweet or chewy finish..
