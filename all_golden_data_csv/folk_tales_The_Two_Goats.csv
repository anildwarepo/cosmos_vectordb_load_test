title: The Two Goats.
text: Two goats, who self-emancipated,—The white that on their feet they woreLook’d back to noble blood of yore,—Once quit the lowly meadows, sated,And sought the hills, as it would seem:In search of luck, by luck they metEach other at a mountain stream.As bridge a narrow plank was set,On which, if truth must be confest,Two weasels scarce could go abreast.And then the torrent, foaming white,As down it tumbled from the height,Might well those Amazons affright.But maugre such a fearful rapid,Both took the bridge, the goats intrepid!I seem to see our Louis GrandAnd Philip IV. advanceTo the Isle of Conference,That lies ‘twixt Spain and France,Each sturdy for his glorious land.Thus each of our adventurers goes,Till foot to foot, and nose to nose,Somewhere about the midst they meet,And neither will an inch retreat.For why? they both enjoy’d the gloryOf ancestors in ancient story.The one, a goat of peerless rank,Which, browsing on Sicilian bank,The Cyclop gave to Galatæa;The other famous Amalthæa,The goat that suckled Jupiter,As some historians aver.For want of giving back, in troth,A common fall involved them both.—A common accident, no doubt,On Fortune’s changeful route..
