country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Andrea Mullineux. This is an interesting wine, made from a 40-year-old, dry-farmed vineyard on the Paardeberg. Pretty floral tones of white clover, honeysuckle and orange blossom dominate the bouquet, with subtly supporting white melon and pear fruits. The medium-weight palate is smooth yet fresh and balanced, with lingering accents of dried grass and soft baking spice that continue through the finish. Drink nowâ€“2020..
