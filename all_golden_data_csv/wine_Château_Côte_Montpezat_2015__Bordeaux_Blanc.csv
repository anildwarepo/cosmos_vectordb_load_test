country: France.
description: Legend has it that those who listen closely to the well of Château Côte Montpezat can hear the pilgrims on the way to Compostella who drank here. Drinking the wine today offers light spice and wood aromas that give it an extra dimension. Initially, they seem to dominate the fruit, although this passes over as the herbal and green-fruit character of the wine shows through. It does mean that the wine should age a little in bottle, so wait until early 2017..
