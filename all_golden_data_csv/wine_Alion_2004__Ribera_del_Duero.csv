wine_Alion_2004__Ribera_del_Duero,"Unnamed: 0: 115804.
country: Spain.
description: Big and modern is the path that Alion (owned by Vega Sicilia) follows. This vintage is excellent, the best since 2001. It offers sweet, ripe black fruit with solid but balanced tannins. Chocolate and leather give the finish sweetness and style, while the overall take is that this is a forceful but sexy wine. Best in a couple of years through 2014. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines..
