wine_Henners_2011_Brut_Sparkling_(England),"Unnamed: 0: 114449.
country: England.
description: A crisp green-apple note has an appetizing lactic edge that shimmers alongside lemon ice cream and sherbet tones. The palate shows lively, small bubbles that fizz excitedly, with further notions of green apple and tart lemon. The midpalate adds notes of sponge cake to counter the freshness, but the exuberant lemon-sherbet aspect wins the day and lasts through the finish. It would be an ace apéritif, totally refreshing and mouthwatering..
