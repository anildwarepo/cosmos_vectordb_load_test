country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Jeremy Walker. Pressed African violets, boysenberry, black berry and cherry all flood the nose of this attractive wine, with hints of licorice and black tea for added interest. The palate is plush, big and bold in fruit intensity and structure, but all in equal measure and overall harmony. Lingering notes of Baker's chocolate, leather and earthy spice carry on through the close. Drink 2020â€“2024..
