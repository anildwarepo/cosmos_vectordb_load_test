country: US.
description: This 100% varietal wine is the winery's inaugural Cabernet Sauvignon and hails from the Rocks District. It's boasts all of Cabernet's prototypical aromas, from black currant to tobacco and herb, with a kiss of vanilla from having aged in 50% new French oak. It's soft and palate-coating in mouthfeel yet retains a strong sense of structure, with lightly chewy tannins. A fine interpretation of the variety with a downright dazzling feel..
