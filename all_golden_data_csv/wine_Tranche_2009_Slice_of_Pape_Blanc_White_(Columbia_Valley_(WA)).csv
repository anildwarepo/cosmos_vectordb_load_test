country: US.
description: Formerly labeled simply as a Roussanne-Viognier blend, this is now the companion wine to Tranche's Slice of Pape Red. Here is a wine with power, balance and concentration. It's a polished, focused, utterly seductive blend, dominated by the Roussanne, but with the Viognier contributing brightness and a floral top note. There's a riot of fruit flavors, from citrus to tangerine to Macintosh apple and spiced pear, with a slightly saline finish..
