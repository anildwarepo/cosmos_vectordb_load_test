title: The Weasel in the Granary.
text: A weasel through a hole contrived to squeeze,(She was recovering from disease,)Which led her to a farmer’s hoard.There lodged, her wasted form she cherish’d;Heaven knows the lard and victuals storedThat by her gnawing perish’d!Of which the consequenceWas sudden corpulence.A week or so was past,When having fully broken fast,A noise she heard, and hurriedTo find the hole by which she came,And seem’d to find it not the same;So round she ran, most sadly flurried;And, coming back, thrust out her head,Which, sticking there, she said,“This is the hole, there can’t be blunder:What makes it now so small, I wonder,Where, but the other day, I pass’d with ease?”A rat her trouble sees,And cries, “But with an emptier belly;You enter’d lean, and lean must sally.”.
