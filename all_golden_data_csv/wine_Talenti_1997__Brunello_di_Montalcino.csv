wine_Talenti_1997__Brunello_di_Montalcino,"Unnamed: 0: 81397.
country: Italy.
description: Riccardo Talenti, grandson of Pierluigi Talenti, the grand old man of Montalcino, currently makes one of the finest Brunellos with the help of consultant Carlo Ferrini. They are now using new wood for aging, and the extra layer of richness this brings is apparent in the comparative accessibility of this wine. Yet it is also huge, with classic tannins and intense, concentrated flavors of sweet blackberry jelly..
