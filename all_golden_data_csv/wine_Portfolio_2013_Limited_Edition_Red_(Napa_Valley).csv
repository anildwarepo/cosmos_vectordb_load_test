description: Robert Mondavi winemaker Genevieve Janssens makes this wine, a small-production solo project that's worth seeking. The 83% Cabernet Sauvignon is sourced from Hendry Ranch and the 17% Cabernet Franc from Detert East Vineyard, a stone's throw from To Kalon. Impressively concentrated and lengthy, within a wealth of power, it is nuanced in black cherry, leather saddle and crushed rock, with the scent of violet never far behind..
