country: Italy.
description: A blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon and 35% Merlot, this is a landmark bottling because many years ago it demonstrated that great international-style wines could be made elsewhere in Italyâ€”not only in Tuscany. A celebrated star of the Veneto, this oak-aged red offers enormous density and intensity, with soft, velvety layers and bright aromas of red fruit, spice and dried sage. The finish is characterized by savory, herbal notes that are fresh and tantalizing..
