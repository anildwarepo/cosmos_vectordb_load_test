country: US.
description: Here’s a soft, supple wine of great character and harmony from an underrated producer. It has pretty earthy-berry aromas. While it’s not very oaky there’s enough to give a hint of smoke and vanilla. On the light side, with soft tannins and somewhat low acidity, but the overall impression is very likable and elegant. This is a racy wine to drink now while your bigger ’97 Cabs are maturing in the cellar..
