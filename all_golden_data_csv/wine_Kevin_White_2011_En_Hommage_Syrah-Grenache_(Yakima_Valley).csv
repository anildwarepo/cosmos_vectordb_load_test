country: US.
description: Olsen vineyard Syrah and Upland vineyards Grenache combine in equal proportions, making a compelling blend that nicely counterpoints the winery's La Fraternité red. Here it's all about blue fruits, especially plums, along with some earthy, barnyard flavors. The structure and aromatics are outstanding, and the acidity of the vintage suggests this wine is the one to cellar, while the other wine is the one to gulp..
