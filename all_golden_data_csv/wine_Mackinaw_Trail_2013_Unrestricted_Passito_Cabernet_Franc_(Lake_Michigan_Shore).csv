country: US.
description: Using shriveled, dried Cabernet Franc grapes, this appassimento-style wine is a new endeavor in the Michigan wine scene, yet it might merit further experimentation for such a cool climate growing region. Initial notes of balsamic blow off to reveal notes of brandied cherries and dried hay. Medium in weight, with fine, sandy tannins, the palate is condensed and ripe in fresh cherry tones that linger on the finish. As a result of the drying process, the alcohol hits over 15%, yet beyond the roundness on the palate, it's quite imperceptible..
