wine_Merops_2005_Ornatus_Red_(Margaret_River),"Unnamed: 0: 85354.
country: Australia.
description: Unusual for Oz, in that the primary variety in the blend is Cabernet Franc (74%), with lesser amounts of Merlot (15%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (11%). The result is a fragrant, slightly herbal wine with plenty of red cherry fruit balanced out by vanilla and chocolate notes. It's lighter in body than most Ozzie Cabs, with silky tannins on the finish. Drink nowâ€“2012. Imported by Margaret River Wines, LLC..
