country: US.
description: The complement to the Camerata from Cadence, this estate-grown blend is 52% Cab Franc and 48% Merlot. There's a juicy core that is delightful, with ripe blackberry and black cherry fruit. Both of the Cara Mia wines see 50% new oak for a full 18 months, and at this early age this shows as aliquorous, almost bourbony aftertaste. The aromatics display dark notes of smoke and coffee, along with some mocha and cracker..
