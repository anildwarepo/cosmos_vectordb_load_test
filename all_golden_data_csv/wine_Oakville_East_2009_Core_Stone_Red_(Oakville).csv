country: US.
description: Very rich and voluptuous, this has ripe blackberry fruit that has a roasted character, as if the berries spent a moment on the grill. It's deep and impressive, showing tiers of complexity, but it's also very tannic, with a dry, astringent kick that makes it seemingly undrinkable now. Made from mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, with a drop of Petit Verdot, it's a wine that needs considerable time in the cellar. Hold until after 2018..
