country: US.
description: Tasted blind alongside the 2005 and 2010 vintages, this bottling, which is Chad Melville's first for his family winery after years focused on the vineyard, carries the same persistent sizzle of acidity on the front of the sip. But it's fresher on the nose, with pear juice, lychee and vanilla dust, and more approachable on the tropical palate, where jasmine, exotic banana, papaya, plumeria and a touch of guava shine..
