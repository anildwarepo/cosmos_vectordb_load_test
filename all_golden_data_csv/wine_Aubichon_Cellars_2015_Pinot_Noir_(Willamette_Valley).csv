country: US.
description: Rich round cherry fruit, lightly infused with tobacco highlights, introduces this delicious wine. There is a pleasing softness to the palate, without it being in any way flat or flabby. The fruit seems more mature than the young vintage would suggest, and it's drinking more like a wine from half a decade ago, which means you don't need to cellar it to get cellar-style flavors. Pie cherry, orange peel and even a touch of pineapple peeks through the lingering finish..
