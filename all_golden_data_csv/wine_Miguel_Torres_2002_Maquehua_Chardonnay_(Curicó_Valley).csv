country: Chile.
description: Consistency is always a virtue, and once again this wine is creamy, fully oaked and more European in style than most Chilean Chardonnays. The nose is like popcorn, with apple and peach in the background. Flavors of banana, coconut, melon and apple carry the rich palate, while the finish is smooth and oaky. This is very good Chardonnay even if it lacks the extra elements required of a great wine. Drink now for its freshness..
