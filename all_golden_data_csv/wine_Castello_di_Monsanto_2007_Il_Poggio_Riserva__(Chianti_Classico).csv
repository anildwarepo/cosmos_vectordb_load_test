country: Italy.
description: This gorgeous wine, a blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo and Colorino, opens with aromas that recall underbrush, mint, woodland berries and balsamic herbs. The palate offers layers of sour cherry and white pepper accented with exotic Asian spices and sage that add depth. It's surprisingly fresh for the hot vintage and the solid tannins carry through to the finish. Still youthful, this will benefit with a few more years aging. Drink 2015–2022..
