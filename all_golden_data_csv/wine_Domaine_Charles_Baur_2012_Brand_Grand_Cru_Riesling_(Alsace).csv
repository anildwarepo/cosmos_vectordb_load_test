country: France.
description: Fragrant ripe red apples mingle with the more mellow notes of baked apples. Above it all, faint floral notes play beautifully. The palate brings out fresher apple flavors of ripe Braeburn and Reinette. Clean and wonderfully invigorating freshness pervades everything and makes for that wonderful Riesling rollercoaster of ripeness and tartness. Lovely and ready now but will be drinking well until 2020, with a lovely baked apple finish..
