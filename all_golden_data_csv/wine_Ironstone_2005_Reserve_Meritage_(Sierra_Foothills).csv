country: US.
description: Ironstone's aim with this Bordeaux blend seems clear, to produce an ageworthy wine of distinction. They have largely succeeded, although it's a very different style than you'll find from anything on the coast. It shows the briary, brambly tannins and tastes usually associated with Foothills Zinfandel, but the black currant and cherry flavors belong to Cabernet Sauvignon, which constitutes 80% of the blend. Will hold and improve through 2013..
