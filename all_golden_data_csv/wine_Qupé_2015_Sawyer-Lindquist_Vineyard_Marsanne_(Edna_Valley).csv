description: Bob Lindquist may be the only winemaker in California who knows how to make Marsanne in a compelling way, and his only grow more fascinating with each passing vintage. This shows dried apple, light melon, sweet chamomile and tangy lime juice on the nose. Racy acidity and tactile tension show on the palate, with light stone fruit and citrus flavors that will intensify with time in bottle. Drink 2018–2030..
