wine_Matthews_Estate_2005_Claret_Red_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 28205.
country: US.
description: The Claret is half Cabernet Sauvignon, with the other four Bordeaux grapes filling in the other half, and is quite firm, sappy and muscular. It is tightly structured with cassis, black cherry and plenty of dark, tarry undertones. The herbal aspects show in some black olive and black tea flavors; the tannins are strong and supple, and the wine has a sinuous finish suggesting both strength and length. An exceptional value, this wine should age very nicely..
