country: France.
description: After a touch of funky reduction, beautiful hints of herbs appear: yarrow and lemon balm play alongside lemon and crisp green-apple aromas. On the palate, these notions all remain taut along a very linear, slender but concentrated body that owes more to citrus than to apples. There is a powerful enduring core of fruit and stone that will make this last. The flavors echo long and leave the mouth totally clean. Drink now through 2035..
