case_title: Lawson on behalf of the 'Pooncarie' Barkandji (Paakantyi) People v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [2002] FCA 1517.
case_text: Following unsuccessful attempts to mediate the issues within the Claim Group, a further application to replace the Lawsons was successful. On 9 December 2002, I ordered that Ray Lawson, Noel Johnson, Mary-Ann Marton, Jennifer Whyman and Patricia Johnson replace the Lawsons as the applicant: Lawson on behalf of the 'Pooncarie' Barkandji (Paakantyi) People v Minister for Land and Water Conservation for the State of New South Wales [2002] FCA 1517 (' Lawson '). On 29 September 2004, the application was amended to add William Bates, Maureen O'Donnell and Cyril Hunter to the group comprising the applicant. These eight individuals presently comprise the applicant in this proceeding. 4 On 23 December 2004, the NNTT refused to accept the amended application for registration. Subsequently, a dispute about the future conduct of the proceeding arose between Ray Lawson and Noel Johnson and the other members of the applicant group. In essence, Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson believe that the area subject to the claim should be split between two claims, those of the people they regard as 'pure' Barkandji people and those of the other members of the Claim Group. 5 Attempts to resolve the dispute referred to above have been unsuccessful and, pursuant to resolutions passed at a meeting of the Claim Group on 1 October 2005, culminated in the filing of a notice of motion on 14 October 2005. By this notice of motion, an amended version of which was filed in Court on 13 December 2005, members of the Claim Group seek an order under s 66B of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ('the NTA') replacing the current applicant on grounds that the current applicant is no longer authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it. In effect the motion seeks: (a) to remove Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson from the applicant group as well as a third member, Mrs Patricia Johnson; and (b) to add two new members, Mr Murray Butcher and Mr Derek Hardman. Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson oppose the application to remove them; Mrs Johnson has not appeared or made any submissions however it is alleged that, because of her ill health, she no longer wishes to be part of the group that comprises the applicant or to be involved in the management of the proceeding. 36 For the above reasons, I will make the orders sought in the amended notice filed on 13 December 2005. However, it is pertinent to note that in making these orders the Court is not adversely reflecting in any way on the conduct of Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson. There clearly has been a deeply held disagreement within the Claim Group and this has been resolved in accordance with the provisions of the NTA. As was discussed at the 1 October meeting, an order made under s 66B(2) of the NTA does not remove Mr Lawson and Mr Johnson from the Claim Group, nor does it affect their standing according to traditional law and custom. As members of the Claim Group both will continue to have the opportunity to participate in discussions as to the future conduct of the native title claim and it is to be hoped that they will avail themselves of the opportunity to do so. I certify that the preceding thirty-six (36) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Stone.
