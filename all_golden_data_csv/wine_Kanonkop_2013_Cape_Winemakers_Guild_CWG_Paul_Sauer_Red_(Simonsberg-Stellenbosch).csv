country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Abrie Beeslaar. This is too young to fully appreciate now, though it certainly starts to make an impression with tight aromas and flavors of blackberry, cassis, leather, licorice and cigar box. The gripping tannins provide a firm structure and dry finish, though ripe black-fruit flavors of black plum and cherry help to flesh out the medium-weight palate. Lingering notes of pepper, wood spice and anise grace the long finish. Drink 2019â€“2025..
