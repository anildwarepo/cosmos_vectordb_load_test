description: Unbelievably rich and delicious, this is a joy to drink. It continues the winery's long record with this vineyard, reaching toward its apex with this 2009. Made from 100% Cabernet and aged in nearly two-thirds new French oak, it's elaborate, layered and complex, offering juicy notes of blackberry, black currant and dark chocolate, with sweet toast and vanilla flavors that continue onto the spicy finish. If you can keep your hands off it, this will develop over the next 10â€“15 years..
