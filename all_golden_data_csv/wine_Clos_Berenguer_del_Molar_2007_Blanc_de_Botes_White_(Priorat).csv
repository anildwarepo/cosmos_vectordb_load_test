country: Spain.
description: This property is flying below the radar...for now. This is yet another excellent wine from Clos Berenguer. The nose is full of butterscotch and oxidized aromas of fine Sherry. The palate has a big feel, purity and fine acidity, while flavors of smoke, toast and oxidized white fruits finish waxy, creamy, oaky and long. This Garnacha-heavy blend would go great with fish or lobster done in a butter sauce..
