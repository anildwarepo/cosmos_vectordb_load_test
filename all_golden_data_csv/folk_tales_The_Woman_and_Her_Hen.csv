title: The Woman and Her Hen.
text: A Thrifty Woman kept a Hen that could be depended on to lay an egg every morning. The watchful Woman thought within herself, “If I were to double my Hen’s allowance of barley, she would lay twice a day.”So she tried her plan, and the Hen became so fat and sleek that she left off laying at all.Thrift sometimes overreaches, and figures are not always facts..
