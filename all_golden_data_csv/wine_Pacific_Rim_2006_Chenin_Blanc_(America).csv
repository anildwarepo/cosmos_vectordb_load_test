country: US.
description: Chenin Blanc may arguably be the least-appreciated great white grape in the world; outside of the Loire valley, no one bothers to showcase it. But Washington state has some Chenin vines approaching 30 years of age, and that fruit is the centerpiece of this ripe, round, floral and slightly spritzy offering from Pacific Rim. Fruit flavors of ripe pear and key lime make this a vivacious and lip-smacking crowd-pleaser, lifted with natural acids and finished at just 12.5% alcohol..
