country: US.
description: The winery's top estate-grown Cabernet, meticulously crafted to age, this is pungent in cardamon and clove, wrapped around hardbound layers of blackberry and raspberry. Elegant and refined, with chalky tannins that will further soften over time, it offers a polished, elegant expression of dried cherries, dark chocolate and brown sugar to round out the finish. This beautiful wine should continue to show well through 2030â€“2040..
