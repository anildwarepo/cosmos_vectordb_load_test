country: US.
description: This young Pinot Noir is difficult and challenging. It's all acidity, cherries and pomegranates, tightly wound and aloof, giving little of itself. Yet there's enormous promise. The color is pale for a California Pinot, the alcohol is modest, and there are tantalizing hints of herbs, minerals, forest undergrowth, mushrooms, cedar, truffles. All indications suggest that this is a seriously ageable wine. Cellar until at least 2015..
