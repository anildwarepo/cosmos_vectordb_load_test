country: US.
description: This exceptional vineyard, more than 35-years-old, brings a wealth of subtle details to a wine that has both grace and power. There's truffle, earth, mocha, plum, spice, coffee and on and on it goes, all well integrated already. Experience would suggest that wines from this vineyard, previously made for Sineann, are exceptionally ageworthy. Drink now if you must, or cellar and drink from 2022 to 2030..
