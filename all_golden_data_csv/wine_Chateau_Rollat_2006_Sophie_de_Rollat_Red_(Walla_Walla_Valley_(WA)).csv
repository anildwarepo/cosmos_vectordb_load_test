country: US.
description: Rollat's Sophie occupies the entry-level rung on the ladder, behind the elegant and polished Rollat and the dense, compact and highly cellar-worthy Edouard. But Sophie is charming and accessible, a blend of 50% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc that is elegant and bright. The fruit focus is on cranberry and raspberry, tart and well-defined, and the wine is immaculately clean. It's light and charming, but a perfect choice for autumnal foods..
