wine_Château_Haut-Brion_2013__Pessac-Léognan,"Unnamed: 0: 102821.
country: France.
description: This wine is structured with impressively ripe fruit. Black-plum juice and blackberries are balanced with a strong tannic content that gives the wine backbone and structure. It has weight, although with its already exuberant fruitiness, it is not likely to be really long-term wine. Drink from 2024. From 120 acres, only the best grapes go into this top wine and 2013 was a smaller crop than the average (10,000 to 12,000 cases). Believed to be the oldest of the five Bordeaux first growths, Haut-Brion has been in the Clarence Dillon family since 1935. The current president is Prince Robert de Luxembourg..
