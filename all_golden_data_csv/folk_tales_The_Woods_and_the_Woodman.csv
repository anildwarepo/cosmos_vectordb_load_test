title: The Woods and the Woodman.
text: A certain wood-chopper lost or brokeFrom his axe’s eye a bit of oak.The forest must needs be somewhat sparedWhile such a loss was being repair’d.Came the man at last, and humbly pray’dThat the woods would kindly lend to him—A moderate loan—a single limb,Whereof might another helve be made,And his axe should elsewhere drive its trade.O, the oaks and firs that then might stand,A pride and a joy throughout the land,For their ancientness and glorious charms!The innocent Forest lent him arms;But bitter indeed was her regret;For the wretch, his axe new-helved and whet,Did nought but his benefactress spoilOf the finest trees that graced her soil;And ceaselessly was she made to groan,Doing penance for that fatal loan.Behold the world-stage and its actors,Where benefits hurt benefactors!—A weary theme, and full of pain;For where’s the shade so cool and sweet,Protecting strangers from the heat,But might of such a wrong complain?Alas! I vex myself in vain;Ingratitude, do what I will,Is sure to be the fashion still..
