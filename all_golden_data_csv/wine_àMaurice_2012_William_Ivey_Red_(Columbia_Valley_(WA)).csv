country: US.
description: This wine is half Cabernet Sauvignon, with the balance Merlot and Cabernet Franc. It draws you into the glass with light, high-toned aromas of herbs, flowers and assorted spices. The palate brings a medley of black and red-fruit flavors, with herbal accents that display deftness, elegance and length. It's drinking well now but should only improve with additional time in the bottle. Best after 2018..
