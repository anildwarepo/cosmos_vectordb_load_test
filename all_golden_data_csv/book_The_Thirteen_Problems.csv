Description: The Tuesday Night Club is a venue where locals challenge Miss Marple to solve recent crimes... One Tuesday evening a group gathers at Miss Marple's house and the conversation turns to unsolved crimes... The case of the disappearing bloodstains; the thief who committed his crime twice over; the message on the death-bed of a poisoned man which read 'heap of fish'; the strange case of the invisible will; a spiritualist who warned that 'Blue Geranium' meant death... Now pit your wits against the powers of deduction of the 'Tuesday Night Club'..
