country: Italy.
description: If you are not familiar with the hearty Montepulciano grape variety from central Italy but adore modern, structured, New World reds, you should considered adding this wine to your weekly shopping list. Thick in power, extracts and color, Montepulciano has rock-solid tannins and blockbuster aromas of blackberry, prune, chocolate, spice and toast that appear naturally, even without wood aging. This is a big value wine that should pair with a big value meal of barbecued baby back ribs in smoked sauce and spicy potato salad..
