wine_Gramercy_2012_Reserve_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 45584.
country: US.
description: The winery's first reserve-level Cabernet, this is pure Cabernet from the Phinny Hill (60%) and Bacchus vineyards. It offers heady aromas of dried herbs, black currant, cherry, tobacco and graphite. The flavors are tightly wound, immediately accessible but fleshing out and ramping up in intensity after several days open. It shows impeccable acid and tannin balance and has a long life ahead of it. Best from 2020â€“2032..
