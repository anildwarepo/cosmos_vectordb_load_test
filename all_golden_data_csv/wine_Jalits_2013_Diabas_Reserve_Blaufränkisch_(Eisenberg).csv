country: Austria.
description: Dark red and black-cherry fruit is clothed in the sumptuous perfume of almost-floral new oak. Toasty oak notes also appear on the fluid and compact body. Juicy black cherry fruit at the core is edged with bright freshness. A touch of white pepper can be glimpsed through the fruit. The structure shows fine tannins, still crunching like starched velvet but beginning to yield. If you like the crunch, drink this wine now, if you like evolution, it will reward patience. The core of brilliant cherry and bluebery fruit promises to continue shining. Drink now–2030..
