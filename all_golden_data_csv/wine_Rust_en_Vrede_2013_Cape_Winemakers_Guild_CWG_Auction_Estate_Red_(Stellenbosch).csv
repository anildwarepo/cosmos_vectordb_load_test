country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Coenie Snyman. Deep, almost liquorous aromas of cassis, black cherry and raspberry sauce lead the nose of this concentrated wine. A blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Syrah, 5% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot, the ripe, lush palate offers ample tannic structure, but is lifted by vibrant acidity and a fruity juiciness that carries through to the finish. Hints of bittersweet chocolate and licorice root unfold on the back on the close. It's approachable now, and should continue to age well through 2022..
