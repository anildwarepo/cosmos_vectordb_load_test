country: US.
description: The 2010 vintage wines from Washington can be unforgiving on release but this wine—already a full five years old—is an exception. It shows a compelling assortment of jammy red and black fruit along with milk chocolate and barrel spices. The flavors convey both power and finesse with a spot-on sense of balance and a long finish that kicks it up a notch. It's drinking beautifully now but has a long life in front of it. Best from 2020 to 2027..
