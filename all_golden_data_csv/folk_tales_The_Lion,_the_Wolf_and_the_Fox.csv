title: The Lion, the Wolf and the Fox.
text: A Lion, old, and impotent with gout,Would have some cure for age found out.This king, from every species,—Call’d to his aid the leeches.They came, from quacks without degreeTo doctors of the highest fee.Advised, prescribed, talk’d learnedly;But with the restCame not Sir Cunning Fox, M.D.Sir Wolf the royal couch attended,And his suspicions there express’d.Forthwith his majesty, offended,Resolved Sir Cunning Fox should come,And sent to smoke him from his home.He came, was duly usher’d in,And, knowing where Sir Wolf had been,Said, “Sire, abused your royal earHas been by rumours insincere;To wit, that I’ve been self-exemptFrom coming here, through sheer contempt.But, sire, your royal health to aid,I vow’d to make a pilgrimage,And, on my way, met doctors sage,In skill the wonder of the age,Whom carefully I did consultAbout that great debilityTerm’d in the books senility,Of which you fear, with reason, the result.You lack, they say, the vital heat,By age extreme become effete.Drawn from a living wolf, the hideShould warm and smoking be applied.Sir Wolf, here, won’t refuse to giveHis hide to cure you, as I live.”The king was pleased with this advice.Flay’d, jointed, served up in a trice,Sir Wolf first wrapped the monarch up,Then furnish’d him whereon to sup.Beware, ye courtiers, lest ye gain,By slander’s arts, less power than pain..
