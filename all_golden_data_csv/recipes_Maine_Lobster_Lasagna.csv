.
Description: I made up this lobster lasagna recipe because my hubby wanted to try a lasagna made with lobster meat. Serve with a tossed garden salad and oven-toasted garlic bread..
.
Ingredients:.
- 1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese.
- 2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese.
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese.
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese.
- 2 large eggs.
- 1 medium onion, minced.
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley.
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic.
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper.
- 2 (16 ounce) jars Alfredo pasta sauce.
- 16 no-boil lasagna noodles.
- 2 pounds cooked and cubed lobster meat.
- 1 (10 ounce) package baby spinach leaves.
.
Instructions:.
- Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish..
- Place ricotta cheese into a large bowl. Stir in 1 cup Cheddar, 1/2 cup mozzarella, 1/2 cup Parmesan, and eggs. Mix in onion, parsley, garlic, and pepper..
- Spread 1 1/2 cups Alfredo sauce over the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Top with a layer of 4 lasagna noodles. Arrange 1/3 of the lobster meat over noodles, then cover with 1/3 of the spinach and another layer Alfredo sauce. Repeat layers twice more: noodles, lobster meat, spinach, and sauce. Sprinkle remaining Cheddar, mozzarella, and Parmesan over top. Give the whole pan a gentle shake to get everything settled in..
- Cover the baking dish loosely with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking until cheese is browned, about 10 more minutes..
- Let stand for 10 minutes before serving..
