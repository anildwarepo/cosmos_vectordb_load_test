country: US.
description: It's hard to choose a favorite amidst Wiemer's 2012 lineup, but this one is a strong contender. It's brisk, yet intensely penetrating on the nose and palate, with a luscious, juicy palate full of sweet white peach and mango flavors. Zesty lemon-lime acidity and a crush of minerals linger on the finish. It's a complex yet effortlessly enjoyable medium-sweet Riesling to savor now, or through 2021â€“2024..
