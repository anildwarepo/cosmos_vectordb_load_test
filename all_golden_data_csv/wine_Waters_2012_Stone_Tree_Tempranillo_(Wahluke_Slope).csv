country: US.
description: This is the winery's first commercial release of this varietal, all aged in neutral French oak. It offers nuanced aromas of spice, tobacco, vanilla and savory notes that are followed by plentiful, palate-coating red and blue-fruit flavors that extend out through a long, fruit and spice-filled finish. Firm tannins provide the structure. It needs time still but possesses a delicious factor that is impossible to ignore..
