country: France.
description: A golden color and a nose of honeyed evolution, reminiscent of fresh field mushrooms and chalk already hint at a vintage wine. The palate surprises with the most gentle, generous and balmy fruit, like an essence of peach, without resorting to any sweetness added by dosage. Its fruity freshness is truly astonishing. This is an evolved, gloriously fresh testament to what Crémant d'Alsace can be. This might work better alongside food than as an apéritif. In any case: let it speak to you and savor the long finish..
