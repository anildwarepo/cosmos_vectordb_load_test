description: Subtle and soft, this aromatic Bordeaux blend (54% Cab Sauvignon, 9% Carmenère, 9% Merlot, 10% Malbec, 18% Petit Verdot) is laced with herb and exotic and savory spices, woven through tight fruit flavors of blueberry and musky grape. This is a delicate, evocative and challenging wine that rewards your attention. Fascinating and complex, it needs time to breathe and good glassware to really open up..
