country: Germany.
description: The Thanisch wines from the Doctor vineyard rarely stand out in our magazine's blind tastings, making their value proposition questionable. That said, this is a finely elegant wine, with floral details on the nose and enduring stony notes on the finish that mark it as something special. At only 7.5% abv, you'd expect an intensely sweet wine, but the sugars are amply buffered by acids and minerality, so the overall impression is one of richness without excessive weight rather than sugary sweetness..
