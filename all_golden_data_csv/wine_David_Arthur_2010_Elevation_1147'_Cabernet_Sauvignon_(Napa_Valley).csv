description: Here we have a fascinating wine that's elegant and opulent, massive and controlled, flattering yet elusive, all at once. That combination of opposites gives it intellectual interest, a wine worth thinking and talking about. Technically, it's dry, fairly high in alcohol and oaky. The 100% Cabernet grapes off the estate are incredibly concentrated in black currants and cassis, showing their sunny, high elevation origins on Pritchard Hill. The wine is not perfect. There's a certain hollowness mid-palate, which has to be attributed to the challenging vintage. But it's a fabulous Cabernet to drink now, and it will reward cellaring for 10 years..
