country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Nicky Versfeld. The only 100% Sémillon in the CWG lineup, this is a treat. Upfront, the bouquet is rich and decadent, with toasty scents of cedar-grilled apple, peach pit and spiced orange peel as well as a touch of lemon verbena that subtly shines through. The palate is creamy and full, but countered by bright acidity and citrusy freshness that holds on alongside the oak spice on the lengthy finish. It's approachable now, but would really benefit from a few years of maturity; try after 2019..
