- 6 cups boiling water.
- 2 cups uncooked long-grain white rice.

Instructions:.
- Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart baking dish..

- Cook and stir onions in the reserved bacon drippings until translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in crumbled bacon, tomato sauce, tomato paste, sugar, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce; bring the mixture to a simmer, reduce heat, and continue to simmer for 10 minutes..
- Spoon cooked rice into the prepared baking dish and stir the tomato-bacon mixture into the rice until evenly combined..
