country: US.
description: Sweet meets earthy, with aromas that recall grilled beets, cola and sassafras. The bottling comes from the father-son team of Tondré and Joe Alarid, who planted their vineyard in 1997 and combined have nearly a century's worth of farming experience in the Salinas Valley. Homemade cranberry sauce wins the palate, and the wine has more tannins than most Pinot Noirs of similar age. Enjoy now or cellar until 2016 for even more emerging flavors..
