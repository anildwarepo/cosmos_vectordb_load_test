country: US.
description: At the top of the Rancho Zabaco hierarchy are the Zinfandels from the company's Chiotti and Stefani vineyards. Unfortunately there will be no Stefani in 2000, but the Chiotti is very good. It's very young, and takes a bit of coaxing to tease out aromas of toast, dried spices and blackberries before flowing smoothly across the palate in a wave of briary fruit. Finishes with firm acidity and a bit of black pepper. Drink now..
