Description: Welcome to the retirement home of Henry and Frances, ex - New Yorkers and professional assassins. A luxury hotel suite in an idyllic, tequila - drenched Caribbean hideaway. It's supposed to be all cocktails and sex on the beach. But when a job icing a Mafioso godfather goes awry, trouble hits paradise . . . in the form of a cross - dressing capo, a debaunched and savage Irish hardman and a slew of incompetant but vicious US marshals. Mix yourself a Tequila Sunrise and dive into Gone Bamboo..
