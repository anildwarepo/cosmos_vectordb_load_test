country: US.
description: This is pure Cabernet from one of Washington's oldest vineyards. Cold Creek is a hot site, and its grapes are scattered throughout many of the Ste. Michelle brands, often providing the core fruit. Here is the essence, a wine that opens a bit grudgingly, but has structure and concentration if you take the time to let it blossom. Dense cherry and cassis fruit is tightly wound with balancing acids. The use of new oak is restrained, but sufficient, and this is a wine that should age nicely for many years..
