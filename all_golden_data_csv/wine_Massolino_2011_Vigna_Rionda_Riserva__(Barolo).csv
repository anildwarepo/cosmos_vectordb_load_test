description: From one of the most celebrated vineyards in the entire Barolo denomination, this gorgeous wine boasts captivating aromas of new leather, underbrush, ripe berry, tobacco, a whiff of tilled soil and a balsamic note. Seamlessly combining elegance and structure, the long, compelling palate delivers layers of juicy black cherry, ripe raspberry, licorice and clove alongside a backbone of noble tannins. It's already a fantastic showing and will age wonderfully for decades. Drink 2021–2046..
