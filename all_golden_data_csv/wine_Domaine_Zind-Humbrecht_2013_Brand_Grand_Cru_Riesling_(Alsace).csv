country: France.
description: Very faint notes of mandarine and earth emanate from this delicate, closed wine. All the flavors are subdued and delicate with flinty smoke making an appearance here and there. All of this suggests that this is far too young to be approached: the structure, however, suggests delicacy and balance, tender flavors of linearity and precision. Smoke and salt characterize the long finish. Drink 2019–2035..
