description: One of the few Syrahs from this cool-climate vineyard on the appellation's western edge, this bottling is an expert take on savory, with black and white papper, crushed rosemary, potpourri, oregano and anise seed spicing up the fresh-pressed boysenberry fruit. A wondrous array of peppercorns and tart black fruit show once sipped, with elderberry and underripe black currants mixed amongst fennel, dill, oregano and charred meats..
