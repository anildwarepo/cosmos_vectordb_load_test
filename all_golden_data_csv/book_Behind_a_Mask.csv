Description: Six years before she wrote Little Women, Louisa May Alcott, in financial straits, entered ""Pauline's Passion and Punishment,"" a novelette, in a newspaper contest. Not only did it win the $100 prize, but, published anonymously, it marked the first in the series of ""blood & thunder tales"" that would be her livelihood for years. In Behind a Mask, editor Madeleine Stern introduces four Alcott thrillers: ""Pauline's Passion and Punishment,"" ""The Mysterious Key,"" ""The Abbot's Ghost,"" and the title story, ""Behind a Mask."" First published in one volume in 1975, they are regarded as Alcott's finest work in this genre..
