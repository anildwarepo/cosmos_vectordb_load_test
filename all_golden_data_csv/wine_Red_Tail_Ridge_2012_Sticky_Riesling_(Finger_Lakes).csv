country: US.
description: Despite a growing number of quality sweet-style Rieslings from the Finger Lakes, this one stands out amongst its peers. It's gorgeously complex, with layers of pollen and saffron accenting deep, concentrated flavors of mango, orange and peach. Searing lemon acidity drives the midpalate towards a long finish that's peppered with dusty mineral notes. Delicious now, but bound to be irresistible from 2021â€“2024..
