description: A heady and rich wine right from the start, this opens with seductive notes of brambly blackberry, wild raspberry, sweet spice, licorice and toast. It's full and weighty, with a texture like crushed velvet and a deep palate that continues to provide additional layers of flavor with each sip. Sweet spice, cocoa powder and mocha flavors linger on the evolving finish. Drink from 2017-2020. Monsieur Touton Selection Ltd, Dalbavie Selection LLC..
