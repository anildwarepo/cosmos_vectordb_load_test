country: France.
description: Subtle but persistent notes of ripe pear, sandalwood and mirabelle appear on the nose. The palate is powerful and concentrated, weighing in with bundled notes of ripe orange zest that lend bright structure to an abundance of pear and earth notes. This is a big ripe wine, full flavored and potent. It has barely begun its trajectory and will acquire even more spice and allure over the years. This really is one to lay down. Drink 2020–2030..
