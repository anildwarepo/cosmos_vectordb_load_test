country: South Africa.
description: With 16 months spent in 100% new French oak, this is a powerhouse of a wine. At first a bit overripe on the nose with notes of berry jam, kirsch, cigar box spice and a hint of smoke, the mouth shows similar concentrated dark fruit flavors but is lifted by supporting acidity, aggressive tannins and a tight structure. Dark chocolate-covered roasted espresso beans flood the long finish, and while the wine is good now, with five-plus years in the cellar it will be stellar..
