country: US.
description: This wine is made by UC-Santa Cruz astrophysics professor Joe Miller, who's taught wine appreciation for years. Regal and wondrous, the nose conveys concentrated lavender, violets, cedar, oregano, rose petals and patchouli spicing up a grapy frame. The palate offers red fruits laced with clove spice and earth. Ginger, rose water and raspberry emerge in the midpalate, with just enough acidity to carry it through..
