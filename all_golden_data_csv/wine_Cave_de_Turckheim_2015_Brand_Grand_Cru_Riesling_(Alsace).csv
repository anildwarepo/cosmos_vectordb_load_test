wine_Cave_de_Turckheim_2015_Brand_Grand_Cru_Riesling_(Alsace),"Unnamed: 0: 9926.
country: France.
description: What a heady nose. Tangerine peel, hay flowers and ripe apples all dance and swirl across the senses. The palate takes the swirling fruit and fragrance up a notch, heightened with the intensity of tangy lemon freshness. This has utter precision and concentration, there almost seems to be a life force of stone and power behind it. It's a textbook Riesling with a clean, dry and totally tangy moreish finish. Lovely now but with great potential. Drink 2017–2035..
