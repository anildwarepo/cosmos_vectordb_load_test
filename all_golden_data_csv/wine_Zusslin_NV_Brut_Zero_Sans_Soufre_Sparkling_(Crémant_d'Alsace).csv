description: Fresh yellow apple aromas broaden out into notes of ripe, baked apple. The palate is creamy and beautifully textured by autolysis and shows off rounded flavors of freshly baked shortcrust and pastry. The overall effect is one of poised freshness and harmonious balance. This is dry and taut but generous with ample substance that highlights both fruit and structure—all achieved without dosage and addition of sulfur dioxide..
