country: Italy.
description: This extraordinary wine put Cabernet Franc on the map in Bolgheri. The 2010 reveals an exquisite bouquet of black currants, crushed blue flower, leather and baking spices. The smooth palate delivers mouthwatering blackberries, black cherry, white pepper, thyme and licorice alongside an age-worthy structure boasting firm but elegant tannins and fresh acidity. It's already gorgeous with intriguing depth but it will age and develop beautifully. Drink 2015–2040..
