wine_Mirù_2007__Ghemme,"Unnamed: 0: 36940.
country: Italy.
description: This bright ten-year-old has enticing aromas of red berry, pressed rose, dark cooking spice, leather and a balsamic note. Balancing ripe fruit and finesse, the juicy palate delivers succulent cherry, cranberry, star anise and white pepper set against a backbone of refined tannins and fresh acidity. A savory mineral note closes the lingering finish. It's smooth and enjoyable now but will offer years of fine drinking pleasure. Enjoy through 2027..
