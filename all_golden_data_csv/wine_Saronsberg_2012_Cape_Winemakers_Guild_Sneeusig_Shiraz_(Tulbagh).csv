country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Dewaldt Heyns. Big, bold and powerful, this is currently a bruiser, but one that has the components to age well through 2025, at least. Loads of dark blackberry and boysenberry are hit with accents of black pepper, chicory, char and cocoa shavings. The palate is rich and plushly textured, with structured tannins and mouthfilling black-fruit flavors that linger endlessly on the spicy finish..
