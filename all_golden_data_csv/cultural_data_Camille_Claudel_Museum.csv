Application Description: Welcome to the Camille Claudel museum in Nogent-sur-Seine. Discover with this audio guide, on your own, with your family or in a group, the collections of the Museum, focused on sculpture in the days of Camille Claudel.PRESENTATION OF THE MOBILE APPLICATIONThe world's first Camille Claudel Museum is located in Nogent-sur-Seine, a town where, as an adolescent in 1874, the artist met sculptor Alfred Boucher whose support would be a determining factor in her future. The collection is made up of those assembled by Reine-Marie Paris and Philippe Cressent, acquired in 2008, to which were added purchases on the art market thanks to funds from the Patrimoine and the generosity of patrons. In terms of numbers, this is the largest collection in the world, with the forty one works on exhibit offering a full discovery of her artistic career. At the same time, the Museum's constituent collection of sculptures, including monumental works, from the end of the 19th century to the First World War, allows for understanding the artistic context in which Camille Claudel was trained, evolved, and had to assert herself. This application offers a unique itinerary in sculpted art of the latter half of the 19th century and early 20th century. Discover the Museum by accessing thirty commentaries amongst the works and themes of the collections of the Camille Claudel Museum which capture your attention. You can choose the mode of navigation by list or by keyboard.PRACTICAL INFORMATION AND ONLINE TICKETINGHours and prices :Public opening times of the Camille Claudel MuseumWinter hours: 1 November-31 MarchWednesday to Saturday: 11am-6pmSundays: 11am-7pmClosed Monday and TuesdaySummer hours: 1 April-31 OctoberTuesday to Friday: 11am-6pmSaturday and Sunday: 11am-7pmClosed MondayFull price: 7€Reduced price: 4€Free admission for those under 25Free admission for all the first Sunday of every monthAccess :Nogent-sur-Seine is located in the Aube département in the Champagne region.
