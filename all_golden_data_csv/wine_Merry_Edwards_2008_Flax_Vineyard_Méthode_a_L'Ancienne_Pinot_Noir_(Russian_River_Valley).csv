description: Merry Edwards has figured out the magic trick of crafting Pinot Noirs so luscious right out of the gate, you want to drink them now, but that actually are ageable. This one, from the warmer Westside Road area of the valley, is enormously ripe and seductive now, with wild cherry, red licorice, bacon, cola, cocoa and cinnamon spice flavors. Yet the inherent balance of tannins and acids ensures it a long life. What a treat. Now–2016..
