country: France.
description: Notes of chalk, bread and stone precede the bruised apple notes on this beautiful, elegant vintage Crémant. On the palate, the apple notes become fuller and rounder and appear like mellow, baked Golden Delicious. There is purity, structure and precision in the autolytic notes which are supported by pure citrus and apple freshness, leaving the palate impressed but not weighed down. Hints of spice develop in the background while all the freshness makes for a lip-smacking, long and savory finish..
