country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Gary Jordan. This wine is a stunner, exhibiting superb balance between all the key elements–ripe fruits, bright acidity, integrated oak and a lush texture. Rich without being overdone, with attractive notes of toasted red apple and orange zest that are laced with hints of toasted nuts, salinity and chalky minerality. The palate is full and flavorful but not flabby or fat, with ample acidity that keeps the whole experience fresh through the long, toasty finish. Drink now–2022..
