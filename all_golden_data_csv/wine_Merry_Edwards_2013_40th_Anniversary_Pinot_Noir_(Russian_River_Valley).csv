country: US.
description: A special bottling commemorating Edwards' 40 years as a winemaker, this wine is made from a clonal selection created by her in 1975. The fruit is from both the Coopersmith and Georganne vineyards, made in a tiny amount. Built to age, it wraps earthy dried herbs around cherry, strawberry and boysenberry, with a juicy core of acidity. A forested hint of spearmint dances at its edge, as strong suggestions of bacon and pepper build on the finish. Drink now through 2028..
