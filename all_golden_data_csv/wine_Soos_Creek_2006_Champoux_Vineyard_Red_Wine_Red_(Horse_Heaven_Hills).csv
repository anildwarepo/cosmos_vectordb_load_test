country: US.
description: This could be labeled Cabernet Sauvignon; the only other grape in the blend is a 14% Cab Franc component. Rich black cherry fruit provides the solid base, but after that the wine tightens down, so decanting would be essential if you plan to drink it soon. The scents weave together black fruits, spices and licorice; more than any of the other new releases from Soos Creek, this needs more time to settle..
