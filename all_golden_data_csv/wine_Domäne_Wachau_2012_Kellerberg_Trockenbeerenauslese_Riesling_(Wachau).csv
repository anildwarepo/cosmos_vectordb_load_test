country: Austria.
description: Incredibly ripe and sweet apricots, candied orange peel, a touch of fresh spearmint and fresh lemon zest all abound on the nose, and are just the first expressions. Balm-like sweetness and clouds of more apricot and peach play on the palate, but electric acidity runs straight through and lends this rich and unctuous TBA the thrilling freshness and streamlined zestiness of candied citrus peel, finishing with long, lip-smacking deliciousness. Unlike treacly sweet TBAs, this has exquisite freshness and is very enlivening, with real citrus lift. Drink from 2016..
