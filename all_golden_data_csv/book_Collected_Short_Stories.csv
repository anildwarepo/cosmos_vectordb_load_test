Description: Affairs, obsessions, ardours, fantasy, myth, legend and dream, fear, pity and violence - this magnificant collection of stories illuminates all corners of the human experience. Previously published in three volumes - ""May We Borrow Your Husband?,"" ""A Sense of Reality"" and ""Twenty-One Stories"" - these thirty-seven stories reveal Graham Greene in a range of contrasting moods, sometimes cynical and witty, sometimes searching and philosophical. Each one confirms V.S. Pritchett's statement that Greene is 'a master of storytelling'..
