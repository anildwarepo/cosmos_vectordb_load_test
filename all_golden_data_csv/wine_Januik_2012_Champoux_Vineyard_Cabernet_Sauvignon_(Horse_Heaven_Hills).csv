country: US.
description: Almost all varietal (with 2% Malbec) from one of the state's premier sites, this wine draws you into the glass with aromas of coffee, scorched earth, herb, spice and dark fruit. The palate shows a beguiling sense of restraint and detail, with the tannins combed to a fine sheen, perfectly framed acidity and a lengthy finish. It's an exquisite example of the variety that should have a long life ahead of it. It will be best after 2020..
