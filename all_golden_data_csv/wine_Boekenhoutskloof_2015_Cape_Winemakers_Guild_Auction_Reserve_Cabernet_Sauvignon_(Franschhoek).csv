country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Marc Kent. Though perhaps better known for his classic Boekenhoutskloof Syrah or Semillon, do NOT underestimate the power and beauty of Marc Kent's Cabernet. This is a real stunner, packed full of well-balanced and -composed power that suggests this is a wine indented for the long haul. It's loaded with ripe, dense black-fruit aromas and flavors, expressed in waves of black plum, berry and cherry that are accented by pleasant hints of green pepper, licorice root and charred bark. It's bold and firmly structured on the palate, with robust tannins that linger long on the chewy, cigar-box spiced finish. Drink 2022â€“2028..
