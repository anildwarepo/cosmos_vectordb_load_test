country: US.
description: This is tough in tannins and somewhat rustic now, in the way of young Monte Bellos. There's not much to recommend opening it anytime soon, especially if you're a fan of the modern style of accessible lusciousness. But it is rich and minerally, with a fine core of black fruit. Monte Bello Estate (not to be confused with Ridge's similarly-named Estate Monte Bello, which costs far less) is a wine that historically ages very well, and 2009 was a pretty good vintage, so you're safe cellaring it for at least 10 years..
