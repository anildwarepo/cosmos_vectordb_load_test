description: Better known for Cabernet, Ballentine brings a deft hand to their Block 9 Zin, which has earned high scores for years. The vineyard is in Calistoga, and the warmth has coaxed out intricate flavors of wild red and black berries and cherries, mocha, herbs and spices, with a distinct black pepper note. The tannins are thick, but very fine. Among the top Napa Zins, this wine will age for a decade or longer..
