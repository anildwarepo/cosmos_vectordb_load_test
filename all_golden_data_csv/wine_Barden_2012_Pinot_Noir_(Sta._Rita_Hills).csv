country: US.
description: This Pinot is lovely for two reasons. One, it exhibits the tremendous balance and richness of a well-grown Santa Rita Hills Pinot. Secondly, the superb 2012 vintage makes it especially noteworthy. The raspberry and cherry fruit is ripe and fruity, and yet the finish is absolutely dry and complex. So good now, it's hard to recommend cellaring it, but you should, for up to eight years. A new brand from Margerum..
