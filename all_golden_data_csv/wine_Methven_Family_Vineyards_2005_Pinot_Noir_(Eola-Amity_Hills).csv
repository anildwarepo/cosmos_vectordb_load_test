country: US.
description: In general, Eola Hills Pinots lean more to the peppery and herbal side of the line, compared with pricier AVAs in Yamhill county. This well-made wine shows good color and concentration, and it's ripe enough that the herbaceousness is a feature, if not entirely an asset. There's a nice lift to the midpalate, which leaves a residual impression that finishes a bit vinegary, as the wine winds down into flavors of black olive and herb..
