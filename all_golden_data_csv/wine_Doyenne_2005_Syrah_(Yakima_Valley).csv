country: US.
description: This is an aromatic, smoky, herbal and ultimately captivating Syrah. Dense, smoky, tarry and herbal, it is a serious effort from a winery that specializes in the grape. The fruit is a juicy mix of wild berries, cassis and black cherry, with substantial tannins that add herbal, green tea flavors. Give it time to smooth out in the glass and notice how the finish runs on and on into a lovely dénouement of Provençal herb, black olive and spice..
