country: Austria.
description: This is still tightly closed: There are merely some notions of iron oxide on the nose, but otherwise this is brooding and mysterious. The palate, however, has something majestic and sumptuous about it—a warm heart of ripe and aromatic black and red cherry. This just needs to breathe and will unfurl like crimson velvet on your tongue. While this can be approached now as it is beginning to mellow, this will be even better in the years leading up to 2020. Very moreish..
