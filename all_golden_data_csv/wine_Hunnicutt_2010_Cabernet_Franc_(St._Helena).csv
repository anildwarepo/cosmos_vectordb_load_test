wine_Hunnicutt_2010_Cabernet_Franc_(St._Helena),"Unnamed: 0: 63573.
country: US.
description: The wine is blended with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot. Both bring their distinct contributions, the former in terms of firm tannins and black currants, the latter with a soft mellowness and suggestions of sweet red currants. The ripe red cherries seem to be all Cab Franc's. A layer of milk chocolate adds to the richness. Altogether, it's absolutely delicious and worth stashing in the cellar until 2015 or so. It's one of the best Cab Francs of the vintage..
