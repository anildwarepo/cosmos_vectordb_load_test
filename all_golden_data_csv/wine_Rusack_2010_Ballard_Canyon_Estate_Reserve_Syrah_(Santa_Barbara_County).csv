country: US.
description: This is a bold, vital young Syrah. It's from the Santa Ynez Valley, although you'd never know that from the label, and shows that region's affinity for producing superior Syrah, when the farming is good. The wine is full-bodied and fairly high in alcohol, with rich, intricate blackberry, black currant, licorice, bacon, baker's chocolate and black pepper flavors. Delicious now, and will evolve over the next six years..
