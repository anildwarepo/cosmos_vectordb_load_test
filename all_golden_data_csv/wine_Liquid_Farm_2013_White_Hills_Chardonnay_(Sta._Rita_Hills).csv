description: This homage to Chablis blends fruit from Bentrock (49%), Rita's Crown (22%), Zotovich (14%), Kessler-Haak (8%), Clos Pepe (3%), Esperanza (3%) and Radian (1%) vineyards, delivering tight aromas of yellow flowers and grilled peach. It dances across the tongue with playful, squeezed lemon acidity, showing crushed white rocks and baking soda minerality, and finishing its high tones on a grapefruit pith bitterness..
