wine_Il_Colle_2010__Brunello_di_Montalcino,"Unnamed: 0: 15190.
country: Italy.
description: A few minutes in the glass releases quintessential Sangiovese aromas of ripe dark-skinned berry, underbrush, baking spice, tobacco, leather and a floral note. The elegant, balanced palate doles out juicy Morello cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon and white pepper alongside polished, velvety tannins and fresh acidity. It's already almost accessible but also shows staying power. Drink from 2018 through 2025..
