wine_ZD_2012_Chardonnay_(California),"Unnamed: 0: 46479.
country: US.
description: The statewide appellation reflects the fact that the grapes were sourced from Napa Carneros, Sonoma, Monterey and Santa Barbara. That makes it a master of the art of blending. Meanwhile, the great 2012 vintage, which was successful throughout the state, is responsible for the wine's balance. It's rich in tropical fruit, green apple, peach and nectarine flavors, with oak bringing richer elements of buttered toast and vanilla bean. With brisk acidity, it's a gorgeous, versatile Chardonnay to drink now, and the alcohol is a refreshingly low..
