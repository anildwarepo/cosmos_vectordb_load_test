country: France.
description: This wine is ripe, full of spice, toast and intense acidity. It has the herbal character of Sauvignon Blanc along with a fresh, tangy edge. Still tight and closed, it needs to develop; drink from 2018. After two centuries under various ownerships, the derelict Couhins estate was purchased by the French agricultural research institute (INRA) in 1968. After renovating the vineyards, the institute began selling wine in 2007..
