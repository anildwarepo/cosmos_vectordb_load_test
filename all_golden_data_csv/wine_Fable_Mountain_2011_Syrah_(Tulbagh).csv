wine_Fable_Mountain_2011_Syrah_(Tulbagh),"Unnamed: 0: 34119.
country: South Africa.
description: A dark, brooding and concentrated wine, this boasts rich black-fruit aromas and flavors of blackberry, boysenberry and cherry that are flecked with accents of tar, licorice, leather and peppery curing spice. Additional notes of tea leaves, sweet spice, licorice root and chicory grace the finish. The texture is like crushed velvet, with spicy tannins that linger long. Delicious now, but this should age well through 2022..
