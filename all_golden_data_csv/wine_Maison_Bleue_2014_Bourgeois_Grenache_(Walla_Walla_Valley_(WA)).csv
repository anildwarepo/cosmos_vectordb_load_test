description: All of the fruit for this wine comes from Monette's Vineyard in the Rocks District, and it was fermented using 75% whole clusters. The aromas are fresh and perfumed, recalling red raspberry, pipe tobacco, white pepper, pomegranate, kirsch, herb and orange peel. The palate shows mesmerizing purity in its red fruit flavors, which are backed by fine-grained tannins. A thoroughly delicious interpretation of the variety that is nothing short of dazzling..
