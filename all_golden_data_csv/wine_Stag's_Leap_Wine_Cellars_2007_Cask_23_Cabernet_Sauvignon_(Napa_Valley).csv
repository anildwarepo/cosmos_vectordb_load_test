country: US.
description: Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon and aged in mostly new French oak, this is a very elaborate wine. It's quite good, a full-bodied, powerful Cab with a molten core of blackberries and black currants and, of course, a thick, dry layer of firm tannins. It does not seem to have quite the depth of vintages from certain earlier vintages, but it should develop nicely in the cellar over the next decade or longer..
designation: Cask 23.
