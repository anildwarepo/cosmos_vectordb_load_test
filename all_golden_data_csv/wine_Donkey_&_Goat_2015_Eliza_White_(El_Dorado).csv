wine_Donkey_&_Goat_2015_Eliza_White_(El_Dorado),"Unnamed: 0: 24968.
country: US.
description: This wine was made by fermenting the skins and juice of several white Rh√¥ne varieties and Rolle, also known as Vermentino, together. It has a brassy color and more textural elements than usual for a white. Orange peel and toasted almond aromas are followed by dry white peach and white pepper flavors and a firm mouthfeel due to some tannin. With time, it opens up and tastes wonderful in an unorthodox way. Best after 2020..
