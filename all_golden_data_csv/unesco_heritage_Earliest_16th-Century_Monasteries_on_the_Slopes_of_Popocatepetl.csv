short_description: <p>The Franciscan Ensemble of the Monastery and Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption is part of the first construction programme launched 1524 for the evangelization and colonization of the northern territories of Mexico. The ensemble is one of the first five monasteries established by Franciscan, Dominican and Augustinian friars, and one of three still standing. The other two are already inscribed on the World Heritage List. The Tlaxcala ensemble of buildings provides an example of the architectural model and spatial solutions developed in response to a new cultural context, which integrated local elements to create spaces such as wide atria, and capilla posa chapels. The edifice presents two other particular features, a free-standing tower and a wooden mudéjar not found in the other monasteries already inscribed on the World Heritage List as part of the serial property. It contributes to a better understanding of the development of a new architectural model that influenced both urban development and monastic buildings until the 18th century.</p>.
