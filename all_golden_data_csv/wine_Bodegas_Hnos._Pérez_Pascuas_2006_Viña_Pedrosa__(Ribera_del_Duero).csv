country: Spain.
description: Fruity up front, with a bit of Ribera's youthful funk thrown in for good measure. Shows leather, earth, aged cheese and dairy notes alongside ribald berry and cherry flavors. It's a solid wine with no leash; it wants to run so might as well let it. Finishes with power in the homestretch. Best in 2009–10. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines..
