wine_Col_Solare_2008_Red_Red_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 77737.
country: US.
description: Vineyard sources for Col Solare are evolving as the recently planted estate vineyard comes into bearing. This vintage incorporates fruit from several Red Mountain vineyards, though not Col Solare itself, along with lots from elsewhere around the state. Toasty and full-bodied, two-thirds Cabernet, the rest Merlot, Cab Franc and Syrah, this is a nicely blended wine but not yet showing the precision and structural detail of the superTuscans it is modeled upon..
