country: Italy.
description: From the grandson of the inventor of Brunello, this iconic bottling opens with a classic bouquet of rose, violet, berry and spice. The vibrant palate delivers bright wild cherry, white pepper and energizing mineral notes along with impeccable balance and finesse. It's very elegant, with firm but supple tannins and still-nervous acidity. Give it time to unwind and develop complexity. Drink 2016–2038..
