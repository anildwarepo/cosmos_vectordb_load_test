country: US.
description: In this newest vintage of Oriana, the Riesling component has been bumped up to 18%; the rest is half Viognier, 31% Roussanne. The three grapes complement each other well; the Riesling adding aromatics, acidity and a barely perceptible amount of residual sugar. This opens with a vitamin pill aroma that slowly dissipates; the fruit flavors are a mix of pineapple and Satsuma orange, with lots of natural acidity..
