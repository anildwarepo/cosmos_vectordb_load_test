country: US.
description: This Cabernet is a blend of estate and purchased fruit. In a successful year, it rivals Stag's Leap's best wines, including Cask 23, and 2008 was a very successful year. Blended with 2% Merlot, and aged in lots of new French oak, the wine is, in a word, stunning. Rich, flashy blackberry and dark chocolate flavors are anchored by an earthiness suggesting cured olives and dried herbs. Delicious now, this beauty should develop additional complexities throughout the decade..
