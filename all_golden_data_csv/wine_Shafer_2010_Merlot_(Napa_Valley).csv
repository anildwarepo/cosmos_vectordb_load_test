country: US.
description: It's important to not drink this Merlot right out of the bottle, because it's pretty tannic, and thus it's hard to appreciate the wine's beautiful fruit. Give it some time in a decanter to reveal the complex flavors of blackberry, cherry jam, grilled prosciutto, cassis, red licorice, cola and spice. It's unclear if this will age for a long time, but it can certainly be enjoyed over the next five years..
