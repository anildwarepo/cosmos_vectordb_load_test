country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: David Nieuwoudt. This is an interesting Sémillon that's quite distinct and expressive of it's terroir, with prominent herbal notes of fynbos, fresh herbs and lime leaf grounded by green plum and fig fruit tones, all laced with a pronounced saline accent. The palate is light-plus weight and immensely refreshing, with mouthwatering acidity and more herbal characteristics that finish bright and clean. It seems to be in its infancy now, so hold it until late-2017 and enjoy through 2020..
