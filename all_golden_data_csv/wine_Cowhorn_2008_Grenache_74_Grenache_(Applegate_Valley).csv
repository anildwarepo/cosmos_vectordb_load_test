country: US.
description: For those who value a totally natural, biodynamic, unfiltered wine, this is it. The neck of the bottle is lined with purple sediment that is almost psychedelic it's so intense. The wine is fermented with native yeasts, and it's a scrapey, authentic beast of a Grenache, with 15% Syrah in the blend, and it takes no prisoners. Grapey, full-throttle, deep and concentrated, with blueberries and plums, boysenberries and kirsch, it invites both contemplation and hedonistic pleasure..
