country: US.
description: Pomatia is an almost mythical creation—like one of those half man, half beast monsters from ancient times. The blend is not that unusual, but the results might be likened to a sculpture by Picasso—a piece of wood here, an old newspaper there, and a bicycle seat for a head. Not to disparage the wine—it's flavorful and full-bodied, but a puzzler. Funkadelic meets Clapton? Cherries and earth, tannin and tea..
