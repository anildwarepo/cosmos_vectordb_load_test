country: US.
description: This perfumed floral red made from Baco Noir, an underappreciated French-American hybrid grape, offers surprising depth of complexity and finesse. Hints of dark char, porcini and spice mingle amidst prettier tones of violet and black cherry. It's crisp and lively on the palate, edged by layers of fine feathery tannins and a crush of granite on the finish. Ready to drink now, but tuck a few bottles away to enjoy from now until 2022 if you can..
