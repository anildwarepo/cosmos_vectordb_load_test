description: If you're looking for sheer flash in Napa Valley Cabernet, try this one. It's expensive, but worth the price. It dazzles for soft lusciousness, and the depth and complexity of blackberries, black currants, cassis and chocolate, as well as the perfect integration of new French oak. Yet the wine, which contains a splash of Malbec, is dry and balanced in acidity and velvety tannins. Great now, and will continue to please through 2022..
