country: US.
description: Winemaker Norm Yost's decision to release later than most of his neighbors pays off tremendously every vintage. The nose on this bottling is delicate but with tons of sexy, supple depth, mixing red cherry, hibiscus and pomegranate with iron and sweet bay leaf. Perfect red fruits decorate the lavish palate: the tartness of cranberry, the lushness of red cherry, the brightness of pomegranate, all cut by eucalyptus and expert acidity..
