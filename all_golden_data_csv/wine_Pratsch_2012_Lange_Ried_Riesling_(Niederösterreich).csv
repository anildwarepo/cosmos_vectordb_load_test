country: Austria.
description: An enticing mix of lime zest and very ripe, juicy pear present the first impression and unite in a linear, racy palate. As the wine opens in the glass, spicier edges appear: apricot kernels and marzipan make an appearance and promise future flavour development. With thrillingly fresh acidity and a lip-smacking finish, it's almost irresistible now, but with this sort of concentration certainly also good for laying down..
