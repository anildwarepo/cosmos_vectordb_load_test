country: Italy.
description: If there is one quality that distinguishes the wines of the late Giuseppe Quintarelli, it is complexity. Unlike any other producer in the Amarone production area, this legendary artisan magically pulls out aromas of dried sage, Indian spice, crushed white pepper and delicate forest berry. On the palate, the wine is bright, crisp and intense, but never heavy or syrupy. Italy lost one of its greatest winemakers when Quintarelli passed away in early 2012..
