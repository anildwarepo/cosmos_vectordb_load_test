country: France.
description: Grape growers since the end of the 18th century, the Dautel and Cadot families are based in the Aube area of Champagne. The family began making their own Champagne in 1971; now Sylvain Dautel works the vineyard by hand and makes the wine for this small maison. Full-bodied, this has touches of toast from the five years bottle age. The rich fruit also allows plenty of tight acidity into the mix. Drink this mature, well-balanced wine now..
