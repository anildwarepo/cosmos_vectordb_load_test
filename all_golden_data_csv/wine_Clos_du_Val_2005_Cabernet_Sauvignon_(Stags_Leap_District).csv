country: US.
description: Clos du Val has gone as far as they intend to in order to make a ripe, opulent Cab in the modern Napa cult style. But they remain faithful to their Bordeaux-inspired house style, which is leaner and more tannic than most. The result is a natural cellar candidate, with an official alcohol of only 13.5%. Rich in blackberries and black currants, this wine should easily develop over the next 10â€“15 years..
