I was in the Heavens tour and just entering the red room when I could no longer respond with "" I am here"" because it was beneath where I could tap, and I couldn't go any further. Please fix this as I was loving it before this happened on my android Note 8. I also wish that was a way to enlarge the art so we could see details you refer to. For example, I could barely see the watches in the pawn shop of the sandal by the pool. The app is not formatted to fit the screen. The buttons at the top conflict with the notification shade. App locks up an end the tour.
