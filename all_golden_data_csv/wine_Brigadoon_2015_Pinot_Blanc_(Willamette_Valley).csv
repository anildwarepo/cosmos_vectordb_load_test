wine_Brigadoon_2015_Pinot_Blanc_(Willamette_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 115849.
country: US.
description: This delightful wine, principally fermented in neutral oak, and aged sur lie, offers lovely details of apple flesh and skin, white melon, a hint of daikon radish, and the pinpoint persistence that is the mark of superior winemaking. Pinot Blanc can go in various directions in Oregon, but this bright and acidic wine really shows the way to a style that is at once drinkable, complex and food friendly..
