wine_Signorello_2006_Padrone_Red_(Napa_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 14594.
country: US.
description: Lots of voluptuous softness in the mouth, like velvet gliding over the palate. But you'll also experience serious tannins that hit midway, creating a lockdown astringency. Evidence of ageability lies in the massive core of blackberries and cassis, as well as the overall balance and tang of acidity on the finish. This Cabernet Sauvignon-based Bordeaux blend should hit its stride after 2012 and continue for many years..
