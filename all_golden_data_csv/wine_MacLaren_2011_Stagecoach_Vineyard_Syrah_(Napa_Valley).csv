country: US.
description: This Syrah shows the dramatic richness of almost any Stagecoach red. Midnight black in color, it's enormously extracted in blackberry jam fruit, with complex notes of grilled meat, black pepper, licorice, violets and subtle minerals. The tannins are huge, but furry and pliable. If you have to drink it now, give it a few hours in the decanter. But it should benefit by reposing until 2017 in the cellar..
