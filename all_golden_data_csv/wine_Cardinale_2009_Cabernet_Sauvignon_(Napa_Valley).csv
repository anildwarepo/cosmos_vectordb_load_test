wine_Cardinale_2009_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Napa_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 122025.
country: US.
description: The vintage was generally a good one in Napa Valley, and with this '09, Cardinale shows its usual sumptuousness. It's beautiful and elegant, with hard, chewy tannins framing intensely concentrated blackberries and cassis. Blended from various vineyards by winemaker Chris Carpenter, the wine is as stylish as Napa Cabernet gets. Full bodied and heady, it should provide good drinking over the next 12 years..
