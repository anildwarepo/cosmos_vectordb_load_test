country: US.
description: Shea is one of the Willamette Valley's most revered sites, and an all-star list of wineries compete for the fruit. Here the bright flavors of ripe raspberries are elevated with tangy acids, putting a tight frame of citrus around the core. A whiff of sea breeze comes up as well, enticing the taster to explore a bit more deeply. Already irresistible, this evocative wine will cellar well for at least a decade. Drink now through 2028..
