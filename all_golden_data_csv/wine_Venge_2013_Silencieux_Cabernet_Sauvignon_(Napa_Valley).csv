country: US.
description: Silencieux is the winemaker's showcase of five distinct vineyards, blended together into a seamless whole. The sites span from Calistoga through Rutherford to cooler Coombsville and Pope Valley, combining to offer chocolatey plum and red cherry, with the head-turning ability to be both bright and decadent simultaneously. Integrated tannin keeps the texture fresh on the palate, with a lingering waft of anise. Drink now through 2022..
