country: US.
description: Merlot comprises 53% of the blend, Cabernet Sauvignon 40%, and Cab Franc fills in the final 7%. Well built and satisfyingly complete, this tribute to grower Dick Boushey uses fruit from his oldest (25-year) vines. Scents of toast, mint and moist earth introduce varied fruit flavors of boysenberry, purple grape, cherry and plum. It's a big, bold wine that segues neatly into a finish of chocolate and butterscotch..
