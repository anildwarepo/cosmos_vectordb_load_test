description: Winemaker: Bartho Eksteen. This wooded Sauvy shows incredible restraint, harmony and balance. It opens with attractive notes of ripe gooseberry, apple flesh and green melon rind. The palate offers more just-ripe tropical-fruit tones, with a pleasantly pithy texture and lime-rind flavors that hang on through the lingering finish. Enjoy now for the bright acidity, though it should mature well through 2020..
