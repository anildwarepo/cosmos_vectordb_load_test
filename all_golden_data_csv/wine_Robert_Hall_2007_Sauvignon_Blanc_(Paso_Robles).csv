country: US.
description: Part of this wine was barrel fermented, which gives it a creamy, spicy richness. The rest was raised in stainless steel, preserving vital fruitiness and acidity. The result is a richly powerful, interesting wine, vibrant in citrus, fig, melon and spice flavors, that finishes thoroughly dry. Sommeliers should note this wine, not only for its inexpensive price but for its versatility and sophistication..
