wine_Laetitia_2012_Estate_Chardonnay_(Arroyo_Grande_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 102893.
country: US.
description: This is a very pale Chardonnay from Laetitia Winery, which sits just three miles from the ocean amidst vineyards planted on rocky clay loam, and yet possesses an appealing, complex mix of creaminess and crispiness on the nose. There is a slight bitterness on the palate as well as brioche and citrus zest on the finish. This tightly focused wine would perfectly cut the richness of shrimp scampi or other buttery dish..
