short_description: <p>This property consists of 6 components of defence works in Italy, Croatia and Montenegro, spanning more than 1,000 km between the Lombard region of Italy and the eastern Adriatic Coast. The fortifications throughout the <em>Stato da Terra </em>protected the Republic of Venice from other European powers to the northwest and those of the <em>Stato da Mar </em>protected the sea routes and ports in the Adriatic Sea to the Levant. They were necessary to support the expansion and authority of the <em>Serenissima</em>. The introduction of gunpowder led to significant shifts in military techniques and architecture that are reflected in the design of so-called <em>alla moderna /</em><em> </em>bastioned, fortifications, which were to spread throughout Europe.</p>.
