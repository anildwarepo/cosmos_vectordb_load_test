country: US.
description: This has been one of Etude's best bottlings, and 2007 was a great year. If you enjoy sheer, decadent deliciousness in your Pinot Noirs, this is one for you. The palate first is struck by the rich waves of cherry pie filling, raspberry essence and sweet, vanilla-tinged, smoky oak. Then it discovers the soft silkiness, and finally the firm, fine tannins kick in, providing structure. Just beguiling, and should develop in the bottle over the next 5â€“6 years..
