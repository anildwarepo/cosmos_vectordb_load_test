wine_Pujanza_2009_Norte__(Rioja),"Unnamed: 0: 3821.
country: Spain.
description: Typical of the best 2009 Riojas, this is aromatic with scents of berry fruits, graphite and spice all mixed to the right proportions. A well-structured palate features firm but flexible tannins and fresh flavors of plum, berry, spice and mocha. On the finish, darkness takes over in the form of espresso, peppercorn and bitter chocolate flavors. This can be drunk now but will benefit from another 5â€“10 years of aging..
