country: US.
description: An exciting new project named after the cult that once lived in the Guadalupe dunes at the end of the Santa Maria River, this cool-climate Syrah from a vineyard just behind Pismo Beach shows rosemary, fennel frond, white pepper, tar and soy on the nose. The sip starts with a flash of blackberry syrup before the savory hints of charred beef and peppercorns arise. Still a young wine, this will improve with time..
