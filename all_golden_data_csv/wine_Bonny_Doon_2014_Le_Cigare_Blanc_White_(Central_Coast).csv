country: US.
description: Crisp and clean aromas of chalk and lime pith meet with riper touches of honeydew and Anjou pear on the nose of this blend of 66% Grenache Blanc and 34% Roussanne, which hints at a biting acidity on the sip. The freshness extends to the palate, where riper guava tones are deftly cut by citrus peels and finished with a minty lift. The structure is tense and ideal, while the acidity is available but not overwhelming..
