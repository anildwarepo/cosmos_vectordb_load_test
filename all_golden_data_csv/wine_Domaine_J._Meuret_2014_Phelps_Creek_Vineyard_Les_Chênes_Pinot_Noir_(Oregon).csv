description: The second release of this Oregon Pinot project from Walla Walla's Jon Meuret (Maison Bleue) is irresistible. A three-clone blend from a top Columbia Gorge vineyard, it's explosively aromatic, with a strong whiff of pipe tobacco that Meuret believes is a vineyard marker. Those powerful aromatics push into a dense core of strawberry-cherry fruit, enhanced by oak notes. Delicious now, this has the structure and power to cellar well. Drink now through 2028..
