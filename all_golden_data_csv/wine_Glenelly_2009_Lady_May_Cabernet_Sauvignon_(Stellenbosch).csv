country: South Africa.
description: Tight, compact and dense, this should continue to evolve with time, easily through 2020. Deep, heady aromas of blackberry, cassis, black plum, tobacco leaf, leather and licorice dance in the bouquet. The palate starts off ripe and juicy, with fresh black-fruit flavors that give way to spicy notes of black tea, licorice root and charred cedar on the long finish. It's structured and gripping, with fine yet powerful tannins and good concentration..
