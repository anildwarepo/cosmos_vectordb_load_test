country: US.
description: Right on the heels of the excellent 2008, this estate-grown Bordeaux-style blend is equally compelling. Bright and tasty fruit flavors of blueberry and black cherry introduce a lively, polished wine with a firm, complex and layered structure. Seventeen months in French oak, roughly half new, has wrapped the fruit in a nicely-layered, textural finish with highlights of mineral, licorice, black olive and spice..
