country: US.
description: This wine comes from a partnership between winemaker David Galzignato of Jada Winery in Paso Robles, and Mark McWilliams of Arista Winery in Healdsburg. A devotion to Sauvignon Blanc, it succeeds with this sophisticated expression of lemon chiffon and mandarin orange that's bright and complex. With two handfuls of SÃ©millon to the mix, it's medium in body and length, with just the slightest suggestion of caramel-vanilla oak..
