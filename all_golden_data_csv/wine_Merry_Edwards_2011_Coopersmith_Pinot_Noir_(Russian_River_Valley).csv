country: US.
description: What's so wonderful about this Pinot is the way it reconciles all sorts of opposites. It's dry but sweet in fruit, and delicate yet potent at the same time. It's totally accessible now, but enormously complex. Flavors of raspberries and cherries meld with pomegranates and persimmons, as well as mushrooms, tea and licorice. It's a joy to drink now, and should develop in the cellar for at least 10 years..
