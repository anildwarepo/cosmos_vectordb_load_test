First Page Reviews: When I had bard mobile on an eye phone that I had before the phone android, I found alot of great books to read ! It keeps crashing or downloads a book and then says the content is protected and I can't listen to it! I find the application very convenient and user friendly. Much easier than carrying a big, clunky player. I would request that the settings be updated to include being able to set the ""part"", ""chapter"" ""bookmark"" or ""phrase"" to which ever one is most convenient for the user as the default setting. A...Full ReviewI find the application very convenient and user friendly. Much easier than carrying a big, clunky player. I would request that the settings be updated to include being able to set the ""part"", ""chapter"" ""bookmark"" or ""phrase"" to which ever one is most convenient for the user as the default setting. Also add an ""off"" option. I constantly hit the back or forward button on my headset when I am trying to press the stop/play button and it takes me forever to find my place again because it jumps back to the previous chapter. This app is every thing it should be and more. I use it for hours every day. The selection is virtually unlimited--books, magazines, newspapers, articles, whatever I want. You won't be disappointed..
