Description: ""Cornell Woolrich's novels define the essence of noir nihilism.""-Marilyn Stasio, The New York Times Book Review One of Woolrich's most famous novels, this classic noir tale of a con man struggling with his ability to see the future is arguably the author's best in its depiction of his vision of doomed predestination. From the 1930s until his death in 1968, Cornell Woolrich riveted the reading public with his unparalleled suspense stories. Classic films like Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window and novels such as Rendezvous in Black earned Woolrich epithets like ""the twentieth century's Edgar Allan Poe"" and ""the father of noir."".
