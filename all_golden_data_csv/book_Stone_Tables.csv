Description: In this imaginative and vivid interpretation of the story of Moses, Orson Scott Card portrays the conflicts, the relationships, and the trials that drove one man from greatness to despair and back to greatness of a very different sort. The epic tale also traces the journey of a people destined to find their way out of slavery and sin to the light of Jehovah. A moving story of faith and uncertainty, political intrigue and personal jealousy, rebellion and submission. Stone Tables is both a gripping adventure and a brilliant study of human nature..
