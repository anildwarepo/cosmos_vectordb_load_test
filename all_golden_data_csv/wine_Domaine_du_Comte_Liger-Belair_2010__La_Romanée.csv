country: France.
description: A superb wine from a great year, this is powerful and structured, with great acidity and solid, pronounced fruits. La Romanée is a small vineyard, wholly owned by Liger-Belair, next to Romanée-Conti. The wine is rich, spicy and very complex, with black fruits welling up from its depth. With great structure, it brings together opulent Pinot Noir fruits with firm, dense tannins with immense aging potential..
