short_description: <p>The four major town houses - H&ocirc;tel Tassel, H&ocirc;tel Solvay, H&ocirc;tel van Eetvelde, and Maison &amp; Atelier Horta - located in Brussels and designed by the architect Victor Horta, one of the earliest initiators of Art Nouveau, are some of the most remarkable pioneering works of architecture of the end of the 19th century.
