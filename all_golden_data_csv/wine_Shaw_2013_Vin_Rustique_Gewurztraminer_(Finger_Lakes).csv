country: US.
description: Steve Shaw devoted his entire harvest of Gewürztraminer in 2013 to the production of this wonderfully strange yet beautiful orange-style wine. Dusty florals on the nose mutate into flavors of dried apricot and fig in this deeply textural, rippling wine. The finish is fringed with tea tannins and bristling lemon acidity. Unfiltered and unfined, it maintains a murky streak of sediment that may be visually unappealing, but for those with open minds, this is quite a fun wine..
