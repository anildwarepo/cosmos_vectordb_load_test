country: US.
description: From an organically farmed estate vineyard in Chiles Valley operated by the same family for more than 40 years, this 87% Cabernet Sauvignon-13% Merlot has soul and structure, as well a stony minerality that compels. Menthol and tobacco weave between thick layers of dark cherry and plum, complemented on the palate by exotic cardamom and clove. This is one worth cellaring through 2022 or giving an hour or two to open..
