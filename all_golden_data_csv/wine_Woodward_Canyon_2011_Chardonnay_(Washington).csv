wine_Woodward_Canyon_2011_Chardonnay_(Washington),"Unnamed: 0: 32208.
country: US.
description: Woodward Canyon makes one of Washington's most interesting Chardonnays, blending fruit from the old vines at Celilo in the Columbia Gorge, with estate-grown grapes from the western end of the Walla Walla Valley. In this cooler vintage, the wine remains beautifully proportionate, round and fruity, with pretty apple, pear and peach highlights. There is a light dusting of spice, and a lick of caramel on the finish..
