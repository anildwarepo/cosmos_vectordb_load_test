Description: Marilyn Manson in more than a mere rock star - he is a cultural phenomenon. He has created a phantasmal world of freaks irresistible to a generation of disaffected youth, while generating unprecedented controversy and protests from conservative and Christian organisations. In Dissecting Marilyn Manson author Gavin Baddeley performs a cultural autopsy, examining the seminal influences and psychotic sources that have created this fascinating Frankenstein's monster. With its heavily visual approach, the text and pictures form a pathological scrapbook that explore the Manson mythos in an irreverent but deeply authoritative manner. Book jacket..
