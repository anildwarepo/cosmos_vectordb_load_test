country: US.
description: The winery's vineyards are now being showcased in a series of designates. Sisters includes the three Pinot “sisters”—Blanc, Gris and Noir—in a site just below Archery Summit in the heart of the Dundee Hills. It's clean, compact, complex and nicely layered. You'll note a spicy mix of cranberry, raspberry and red licorice, along with more subtle hints of curaçao and chocolate. The structure (and winery history) suggest that this will age quite well. Drink 2018 to 2030 and beyond..
