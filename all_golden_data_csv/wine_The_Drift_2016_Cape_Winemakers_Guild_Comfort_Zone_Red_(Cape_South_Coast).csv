country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Bruce Jack. A curious blend of 83% Tinta Barocca, 8.5% Barbera and 8.5% Monastrell, this is winemaker Bruce Jack's play on considering your, and his, ""comfort zone."" It's rich, robust and full, brimming with ripe black berries, boysenberry preserves, Baker's chocolate, tree bark, black tea and dried iris. Despite all this richness, there's remarkable freshness and mineral lift to the palate, as well as velvety tannins to lend supporting structure. Overall, it's big and bold, but balanced and promising; delicious now, but try after 2021 to see added maturity..
