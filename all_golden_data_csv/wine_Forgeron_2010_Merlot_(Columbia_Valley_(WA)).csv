wine_Forgeron_2010_Merlot_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 103663.
country: US.
description: An A+ trio of vineyards—Olsen, Stonetree and Boushey—contribute equally to this pure Merlot. In a Forgeron portfolio that regularly shines with a variety of red wines, Merlot is usually the best of show, as it is here. Tight, tart and perfectly proportioned, this at first offers scents and accents of sweet tomato paste and a whiff of oregano, then opens further with lush cherry flavors and a dash of dried tobacco. Merlot and pasta? Why not?.
