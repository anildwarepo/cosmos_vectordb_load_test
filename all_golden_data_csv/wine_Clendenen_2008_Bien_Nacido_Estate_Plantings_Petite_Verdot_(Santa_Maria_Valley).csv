country: US.
description: A superb red wine, and in fact one of the best Petit Verdots ever produced in California. It's so delicate, it has the weight of a fine Pinot Noir, which is mainly the result of low (by California standards) alcohol. There's an exquisite range of black cherry compote, mushu plum sauce, currant, baking spice and sandalwood flavors. The grapes come from vineyards the winemaker leased on land at Bien Nacido..
