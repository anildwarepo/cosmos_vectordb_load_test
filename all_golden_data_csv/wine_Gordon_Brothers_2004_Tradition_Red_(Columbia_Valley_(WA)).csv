country: US.
description: Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive..
