country: Italy.
description: From the Val di Cembra valley hidden deep within the snow-capped Dolomites comes this blend of Sauvignon, Pinot Bianco, Manzoni bianco, Kerner and Riesling that has aged carefully in the bottle (for a late release). Tertiary aromas of candied fruit, dusty mineral, honey and ginger give the wine a smooth and elegant personality. This wine is part of a small elite of Italian whites that shows this impressive longevity..
