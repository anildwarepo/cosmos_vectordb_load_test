country: US.
description: This wine, which is 100% varietal, is a blend from the Upland, Stoney Vine and French Creek vineyards. Fermented using 75% whole cluster and seeing just 15% new oak, the emphasis is on freshness and purity. It displays aromas of stems, white pepper, earth, funk and black olive, with the Stoney Vine influence winning out. The earthy and savory palate-coating flavors heighten the interest, with fruit and savory notes sailing on the finish. There are lots of good things going on but it needs time to come together. Best after 2019..
