country: Austria.
description: The perfume of fully ripe, lusciously juicy peach is nearly overwhelming. It is joined by notions of barley-sugar and candied apricot. There is a more tart notion of passion fruit, too, as well as a guiding, lightning flash of welcome acidity that brings a punch of citrus zest. This TBA is like a very potent flavor bomb that not only delivers luscious sweetness but also a counterpoint of acidic thrill. Needless to say, this simply lingers and lasts. Nectar indeed..
