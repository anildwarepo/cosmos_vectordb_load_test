country: US.
description: After a great inaugural 2010 vintage, this is another impressive Cabernet from this winery. The vineyard is in the Pritchard Hill area, and the wine is 95% Cabernet with 5% Petit Verdot. It's a lush wine that's rich in black currant, cocoa and plum flavors, enhanced by smoky oak. The wine shows enormous complexity, with layers of minerals and dried herbs that are hard to describe. It has a long life ahead of it, so drink nowâ€“2022, at least..
