country: Italy.
description: Perfumed berry, dark spice, dried herb, a hint of tar and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find on this striking red. The racy palate boasts finesse and structure, delivering red cherry, raspberry, white pepper and cinnamon alongside bracing but refined tannins and vibrant acidity. This is made for lengthy cellaring so give it ample time to fully develop into the dazzling wine it promises to become. Drink 2021–2036..
