country: US.
description: Powerful yet restrained, this wine beautifully expresses the delicate and nuanced aspects of Cabernet Sauvignon with the herbal side of the grape in full force. Everything is tied together in a neat and tidy bundle, with sweet blackberry fruit surrounded by leaf and earth, leading into ripe but stiff tannins and just the right elements of mocha toast. Will it age? Undoubtedly; but hard not to drink it right now..
