country: US.
description: Made from mostly Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a compelling wine to drink now. It exudes concentrated flavors of raspberry and cherry that taste like they have been baked in pie crust and sprinkled with baking spice. Notes of bacon, licorice and sandalwood add further complexity. The structure is superb, with citrusy acids and supple tannins. All profits from the sale of this wine go to Jonata's vineyard crew..
