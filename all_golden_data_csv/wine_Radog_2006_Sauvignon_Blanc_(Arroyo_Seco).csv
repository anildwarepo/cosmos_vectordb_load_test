country: US.
description: The Arroyo Seco is a rocky bench between the Salinas Valley and the Santa Lucia Highlands. It's really great terroir for white wines because the conditions allow for extraordinarily long hangtime, while cool, foggy nights preserve vital acidity. You couldn't ask for a fresher, more vibrant Sauvignon Blanc than this one. It's bone dry and zesty and rich in pineapple, fig and mineral flavors, with a long, spicy finish..
