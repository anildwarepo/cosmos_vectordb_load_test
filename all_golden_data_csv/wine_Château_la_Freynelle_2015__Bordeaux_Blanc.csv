wine_Château_la_Freynelle_2015__Bordeaux_Blanc,"Unnamed: 0: 53825.
country: France.
description: From its origin in 1789, the Barthe family vineyards were in the hands of sons. In 1991, Véronique Barthe took over and is now developing sustainable vineyards. This vintage is perfumed with touches of fruit candies that will probably integrate better as the wine settles down. Behind this confected front, there is good fruit, crisp acidity and a lively, bright aftertaste. Wait until late 2016 to drink..
