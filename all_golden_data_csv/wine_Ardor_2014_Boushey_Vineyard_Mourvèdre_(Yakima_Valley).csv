country: US.
description: This is a vineyard change for this wine, which now comes from one of the state's top Syrah sites. Coming in at an absurdly low alcohol level, especially considering the warmth of the vintage, it offers aromas of garrigue, lemon twist and generous amounts of black pepper. The pepper and savory flavors are elegant and polished, with a mouthfeel that demands another sip. It's all about elegance of expression and feel..
