country: US.
description: The second of three Syrahs from Betz, this is thick and dark, heavy with still-chewy tannins, this rich and compact wine needs more time in bottle. It's done in a big, toasty style, with lush black cherry fruit set against smoky, chewy tannins. It has a lot of power, but in its current (quite youthful) stage of development it remains stubbornly tight, herbal and hard. Give it plenty of breathing and/or cellar time..
