title: The Sun and the Frogs.
text: Rejoicing on their tyrant’s wedding-day,The people drown’d their care in drink;While from the general joy did Æsop shrink,And show’d its folly in this way.“The sun,” said he, “once took it in his headTo have a partner: so he wed.From swamps, and ponds, and marshy bogs,Up rose the wailings of the frogs.“What shall we do, should he have progeny?”Said they to Destiny;‘One sun we scarcely can endure,And half-a-dozen, we are sure,Will dry the very sea.Adieu to marsh and fen!Our race will perish then,Or be obliged to fixTheir dwelling in the Styx!’For such an humble animal,The frog, I take it, reason’d well.”.
