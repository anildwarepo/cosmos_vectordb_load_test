country: US.
description: At 1,200 feet, the Underwood Mountain vineyard brings a certain illumination and transparency to the Riesling grape. It's a style both elegant and intense, and nowhere else in Washington state except the Columbia Gorge does Riesling achieve this sort of delicate power. Scents and flavors of blossom, citrus and stone fruits combine in a gorgeous display. It's bright, lip-smacking and beautifully balanced..
