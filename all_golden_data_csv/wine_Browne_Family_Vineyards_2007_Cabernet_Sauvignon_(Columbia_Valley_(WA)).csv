wine_Browne_Family_Vineyards_2007_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 85073.
country: US.
description: An interesting blend, with 10% Petit Verdot. The PV puts a rich and evocative bouquet front and forward—a lush and seductive mix of incense, cinnamon, Asian spice and coffee cream. You are saying yum before you take a sip. The fruit tastes young and clean, raspberries and strawberries and Rainier cherries, with enough acid to keep it lively and fresh. Drinking well now, but give it another three or four years and it should fill out perfectly..
