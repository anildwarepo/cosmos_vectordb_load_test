Description: In this authoritative, lively book, the celebrated Italian novelist and philosopher Umberto Eco presents a learned summary of medieval aesthetic ideas. Juxtaposing theology and science, poetry and mysticism, Eco explores the relationship that existed between the aesthetic theories and the artistic experience and practice of medieval culture. ""[A] delightful study. . . . [Eco's] remarkably lucid and readable essay is full of contemporary relevance and informed by the energies of a man in love with his subject.""--Robert Taylor, Boston Globe ""The book lays out so many exciting ideas and interesting facts that readers will find it gripping.""--Washington Post Book World ""A lively introduction to the subject.""--Michael Camille, The Burlington Magazine ""If you want to become acquainted with medieval aesthetics, you will not find a more scrupulously researched, better written (or better translated), intelligent and illuminating introduction than Eco's short volume.""--D. C. Barrett, Art Monthly.
