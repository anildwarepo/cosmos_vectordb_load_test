description: Aromas of mature black-skinned fruit, baking spice, new leather, a whiff of oak and a balsamic note unfold on this powerful, concentrated red, which the winery only makes in exceptional vintages. The smooth, full-bodied palate doles out ripe black cherry, raspberry jam, sweet baking spice and licorice alongside big, rounded tannins. The juicy fruit richness seamlessly supports the hefty abv of 15%. Drink 2017–2027..
