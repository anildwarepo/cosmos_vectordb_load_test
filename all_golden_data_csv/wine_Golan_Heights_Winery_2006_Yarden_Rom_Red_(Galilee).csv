description: The results of a partnership between Golan Heights Winery's Chief Winemaker Victor Schoenfeld and world-renowned winemaker and consultant Zelma Long, Rom (meaning “summit” in Hebrew) is a reference and tribute to the culmination of their relationship. The inaugural effort is a gorgeous wine composed of 37% Syrah, 34% Cabernet Sauvignon and 29% Merlot aged in French oak for 21 months. The result is a powerful, lush and concentrated wine loaded with black raspberry, blueberry, thin mint cookies and savory spice. Full weight with forward tannins and medium acidity, this is an Old World wine with a New World attitude..
