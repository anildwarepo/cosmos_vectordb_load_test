country: Spain.
description: Mauro will always show you a lot, but frankly this 2005 seems soft and chunky. It has rich, baked, black-fruit aromas and then a mildly syrupy palate with huge blackberry and cassis flavors. The finish is wide and rich, but where are the tannins and structure that this wine is known for? Drink now for best results; it may not improve in the cellar. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines..
