country: US.
description: Malbec is probably the most under-rated Washington red, but a wine such as this may change that. It's beautifully styled, tight in the midpalate, but with a broadly fruity entry that mixes berry and plum, cassis and chocolate, with a vein of mint. Winemaker Chuck Reininger has a masterful touch with tannins, and as with the rest of his reds, this is smooth and seductive, without harsh edges but with firmness and flesh. Young and primary, it looks to be a wine that can age for up to a decade..
