country: Italy.
description: Perfumed berry, rose, fragrant blue flower, tilled earth, baking spice and a hint of new leather are just some of the aromas you'll find on this dazzling red. The polished, structured palate is loaded with finesse, delivering a wonderful depth of flavors including raspberry, dark cherry, licorice, mint and white pepper. Vibrant acidity and firm, refined tannins provide impeccable balance. It's still young and will develop even more complexity over the next 10–15 years. Drink 2020–2035..
