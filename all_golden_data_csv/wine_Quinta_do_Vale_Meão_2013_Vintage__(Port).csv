country: Portugal.
description: While the year is not one of the great Port vintages, it has produced some finely structured wines like this that will mature relatively quickly. It comes with great fruit that was teased out of the grapes in traditional open stone lagars. It is, of course, dense and full of tannins as well as fruit. It will develop well and could be drinkable soon (say by 2018) for its fruit although it will then age for many years until 2030 and beyond..
