country: US.
description: Not many people cellar Zinfandel but this is one you might want to for a few years. It's very dry and tannic and extraordinarily dense, with a complex spectrum of red and black currant, pomegranate, molasses cookie, baked cherry pie, root beer, cocoa and peppery spice flavors that go on and on. Shows Zin's full-bodied power, with a fruity sweetness that seduces the palate. Absolutely delicious, but if you're allergic to high alcohol, go elsewhere..
