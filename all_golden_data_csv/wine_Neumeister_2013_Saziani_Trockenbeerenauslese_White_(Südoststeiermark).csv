country: Austria.
description: Lifted, fragrant notes of honeyed, botrytised passion fruit swirl on the nose. The palate is of an intense sweetness cut by a razor-sharp freshness of candied lemon peel and lemon confit. These extremes of sweet and tart create a compelling tension that is played out in ever-recurring waves. There is a wonderful purity to this. It is luscious now but will age slowly and beautifully. Drink now and over the coming decade..
