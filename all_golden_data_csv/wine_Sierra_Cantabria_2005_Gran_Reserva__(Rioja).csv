wine_Sierra_Cantabria_2005_Gran_Reserva__(Rioja),"Unnamed: 0: 119555.
country: Spain.
description: Opens with funky aromas of sweaty leather and cheese that seem rustic for this bodega. Time and airing help the wine plenty, and sooner rather than later it shows typical Rioja dried red fruits, earth, tobacco and spice. Astringent and tight as a drum now, but it will evolve in the bottle and should last another two decades. Not the best Sierra Cantabria high-end wine I've tried but still shows excellence once it finds its stride. Drink from 2015â€“2025..
