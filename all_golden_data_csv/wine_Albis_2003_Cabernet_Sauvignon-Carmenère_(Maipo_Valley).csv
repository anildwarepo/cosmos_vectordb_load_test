country: Chile.
description: One of Chile's longest-held superpremiums is Albis, a joint-venture wine of the Antinori family of Italy and the Matte family from Chile. With this vintage, early mossy and leathery aromas yield to cassis and cherry flavors. There's a leathery, cheese-like element to the finish, which is offset by sweeter coconut and chocolate flavors. At 73% Cabernet Sauvignon and 27% Carmenère, Albis comes on strong the longer it sees air..
