title: Ib and Christine.
text: Not far from the clear stream Gudenau, in North Jutland, in the forestwhich extends by its banks and far into the country, a great ridge ofland rises and stretches along like a wall through the wood. By thisridge, westward, stands a farmhouse, surrounded by poor land; thesandy soil is seen through the spare rye and wheat-ears that grow uponit. Some years have elapsed since the time of which we speak. Thepeople who lived here cultivated the fields, and moreover kept threesheep, a pig, and two oxen; in fact, they supported themselves quitecomfortably, for they had enough to live on if they took things asthey came. Indeed, they could have managed to save enough to keep twohorses; but, like the other peasants of the neighbourhood, they said,“The horse eats itself up”–that is to say, it eats as much as itearns. Jeppe-Jäns cultivated his field in summer. In the winter hemade wooden shoes, and then he had an assistant, a journeyman, whounderstood as well as he himself did how to make the wooden shoesstrong, and light, and graceful. They carved shoes and spoons, andthat brought in money. It would have been wronging the Jeppe-Jänses tocall them poor people.Little Ib, a boy seven years old, the only child of the family, wouldsit by, looking at the workmen, cutting at a stick, and occasionallycutting his finger. But one day Ib succeeded so well with two piecesof wood, that they really looked like little wooden shoes; and thesehe wanted to give to little Christine. And who was little Christine?She was the boatman’s daughter, and was graceful and delicate as agentleman’s child; had she been differently dressed, no one would haveimagined that she came out of the hut on the neighbouring heath. Therelived her father, who was a widower, and supported himself by carryingfirewood in his great boat out of the forest to the estate ofSilkeborg, with its great eel-pond and eel-weir, and sometimes even tothe distant little town of Randers. He had no one who could take careof little Christine, and therefore the child was almost always withhim in his boat, or in the forest among the heath plants and barberrybushes. Sometimes, when he had to go as far as the town, he wouldbring little Christine, who was a year younger than Ib, to stay at theJeppe-Jänses.Ib and Christine agreed very well in every particular: they dividedtheir bread and berries when they were hungry, they dug in the groundtogether for treasures, and they ran, and crept, and played abouteverywhere. And one day they ventured together up the high ridge, anda long way into the forest; once they found a few snipes’ eggs there,and that was a great event for them.Ib had never been on the heath where Christine’s father lived, nor hadhe ever been on the river. But even this was to happen; forChristine’s father once invited him to go with them; and on theevening before the excursion, he followed the boatman over the heathto the house of the latter.Next morning early, the two children were sitting high up on the pileof firewood in the boat, eating bread and whistleberries. Christine’sfather and his assistant propelled the boat with staves. They had thecurrent with them, and swiftly they glided down the stream, throughthe lakes it forms in its course, and which sometimes seemed shut inby reeds and water plants, though there was always room for them topass, and though the old trees bent quite forward over the water, andthe old oaks bent down their bare branches, as if they had turned uptheir sleeves and wanted to show their knotty naked arms. Old aldertrees, which the stream had washed away from the bank, clung withtheir fibrous roots to the bottom of the stream, and looked likelittle wooded islands. The water-lilies rocked themselves on theriver. It was a splendid excursion; and at last they came to the greateel-weir, where the water rushed through the flood-gates; and Ib andChristine thought this was beautiful to behold.In those days there was no manufactory there, nor was there any town;only the old great farmyard, with its scanty fields, with fewservants and a few head of cattle, could be seen there; and therushing of the water through the weir and the cry of the wild duckswere the only signs of life in Silkeborg. After the firewood had beenunloaded, the father of Christine bought a whole bundle of eels and aslaughtered sucking-pig, and all was put into a basket and placed inthe stern of the boat. Then they went back again up the stream; butthe wind was favourable, and when the sails were hoisted, it was asgood as if two horses had been harnessed to the boat.When they had arrived at a point in the stream where theassistant-boatman dwelt, a little way from the bank, the boat wasmoored, and the two men landed, after exhorting the children to sitstill. But the children did not do that; or at least they obeyed onlyfor a very short time. They must be peeping into the basket in whichthe eels and the sucking-pig had been placed, and they must needs pullthe sucking-pig out, and take it in their hands, and feel and touch itall over; and as both wanted to hold it at the same time, it came topass that they let it fall into the water, and the sucking-pig driftedaway with the stream–and here was a terrible event!Ib jumped ashore, and ran a little distance along the bank, andChristine sprang after him.“Take me with you!” she cried.And in a few minutes they were deep in the thicket, and could nolonger see either the boat or the bank. They ran on a little farther,and then Christine fell down on the ground and began to cry; but Ibpicked her up.“Follow me!” he cried. “Yonder lies the house.”But the house was not yonder. They wandered on and on, over the dry,rustling, last year’s leaves, and over fallen branches that crackledbeneath their feet. Soon they heard a loud piercing scream. They stoodstill and listened, and presently the scream of an eagle soundedthrough the wood. It was an ugly scream, and they were frightened atit; but before them, in the thick wood, the most beautiful blueberriesgrew in wonderful profusion. They were so inviting, that the childrencould not do otherwise than stop; and they lingered for some time,eating the blueberries till they had quite blue mouths and bluecheeks. Now again they heard the cry they had heard before.“We shall get into trouble about the pig,” said Christine.“Come, let us go to our house,” said Ib; “it is here in the wood.”And they went forward. They presently came to a wood, but it did notlead them home; and darkness came on, and they were afraid. Thewonderful stillness that reigned around was interrupted now and thenby the shrill cries of the great horrid owl and of the birds that werestrange to them. At last they both lost themselves in a thicket.Christine cried, and Ib cried too; and after they had bemoanedthemselves for a time, they threw themselves down on the dry leaves,and went fast asleep.The sun was high in the heavens when the two children awoke. They werecold; but in the neighbourhood of this resting-place, on the hill, thesun shone through the trees, and there they thought they would warmthemselves; and from there Ib fancied they would be able to see hisparents’ house. But they were far away from the house in question, inquite another part of the forest. They clambered to the top of therising ground, and found themselves on the summit of a slope runningdown to the margin of a transparent lake. They could see fish in greatnumbers in the pure water illumined by the sun’s rays. This spectaclewas quite a sudden surprise for them; but close beside them grew a nutbush covered with the finest nuts; and now they picked the nuts, andcracked them, and ate the delicate young kernels, which had only justbecome perfect. But there was another surprise and another fright instore for them. Out of the thicket stepped a tall old woman; her facewas quite brown, and her hair was deep black and shining. The whitesof her eyes gleamed like a negro’s; on her back she carried a bundle,and in her hand she bore a knotted stick. She was a gipsy. Thechildren did not at once understand what she said. She brought threenuts out of her pocket, and told them that in these nuts the mostbeautiful, the loveliest things were hidden; for they werewishing-nuts.Ib looked at her, and she seemed so friendly, that he plucked upcourage and asked her if she would give him the nuts; and the womangave them to him, and gathered some more for herself, a wholepocketful, from the nut bush.And Ib and Christine looked at the wishing-nuts with great eyes.“Is there a carriage with a pair of horses in this nut?” he asked.“Yes, there’s a golden carriage with two horses,” answered the woman.“Then give me the nut,” said little Christine.And Ib gave it to her, and the strange woman tied it in herpocket-handkerchief for her.“Is there in this nut a pretty little neckerchief, like the oneChristine wears round her neck?” inquired Ib.“There are ten neckerchiefs in it,” answered the woman. “There arebeautiful dresses in it, and stockings, and a hat with a veil.”“Then I will have that one too,” cried little Christine.And Ib gave her the second nut also. The third was a little blackthing.“That one you can keep,” said Christine; “and it is a pretty one too.”“What is in it?” inquired Ib.“The best of all things for you,” replied the gipsy-woman.And Ib held the nut very tight. The woman promised to lead thechildren into the right path, so that they might find their way home;and now they went forward, certainly in quite a different directionfrom the path they should have followed. But that is no reason why weshould suspect the gipsy-woman of wanting to steal the children. Inthe wild wood-path they met the forest bailiff, who knew Ib; and byhis help, Ib and Christine both arrived at home, where their friendshad been very anxious about them. They were pardoned and forgiven,although they had indeed both deserved “to get into trouble;” firstly,because they had let the sucking-pig fall into the water, andsecondly, because they had run away.Christine was taken back to her father on the heath, and Ib remainedin the farmhouse on the margin of the wood by the great ridge. Thefirst thing he did in the evening was to bring forth out of his pocketthe little black nut, in which “the best thing of all” was said to beenclosed. He placed it carefully in the crack of the door, and thenshut the door so as to break the nut; but there was not much kernel init. The nut looked as if it were filled with tobacco or black richearth; it was what we call hollow, or worm-eaten.“Yes, that’s exactly what I thought,” said Ib. “How could the verybest thing be contained in this little nut? And Christine will getjust as little out of her two nuts, and will have neither fine clothesnor the golden carriage.”And winter came on, and the new year began; indeed, several years wentby.Ib was at last to be confirmed; and for this reason he went during awhole winter to the clergyman, far away in the nearest village, toprepare. About this time the boatman one day visited Ib’s parents, andtold them that Christine was now going into service, and that she hadbeen really fortunate in getting a remarkably good place, and fallinginto worthy hands.“Only think,” he said; “she is going to the rich innkeeper’s, in theinn at Herning, far towards the west, many miles from here. She is toassist the hostess in keeping the house; and afterwards, if she takesto it well, and stays to be confirmed there, the people are going toadopt her as their own daughter.”And Ib and Christine took leave of one another. People called them“the betrothed;” and at parting, the girl showed Ib that she had stillthe two nuts which he had given her long ago, during their wanderingsin the forest; and she told him, moreover, that in a drawer she hadcarefully kept the little wooden shoes which he had carved as apresent for her in their childish days. And thereupon they parted.Ib was confirmed. But he remained in his mother’s house, for he hadbecome a clever maker of wooden shoes, and in summer he looked afterthe field. He did it all alone, for his mother kept no farm-servant,and his father had died long ago.Only seldom he got news of Christine from some passing postillion oreel-fisher. But she was well off at the rich innkeeper’s; and aftershe had been confirmed, she wrote a letter to her father, and sent akind message to Ib and his mother; and in the letter there was mentionmade of certain linen garments and a fine new gown, which Christinehad received as a present from her employers. This was certainly goodnews.Next spring, there was a knock one day at the door of our Ibis oldmother, and behold, the boatman and Christine stepped into the room.She had come on a visit to spend a day: a carriage had to come fromthe Herning Inn to the next village, and she had taken the opportunityto see her friends once again. She looked as handsome as a real lady,and she had a pretty gown on, which had been well sewn, and madeexpressly for her. There she stood, in grand array, and Ib was in hisworking clothes. He could not utter a word: he certainly seized herhand, and held it fast in his own, and was heartily glad; but he couldnot get his tongue to obey him. Christine was not embarrassed,however, for she went on talking and talking, and, moreover, kissed Ibon his mouth in the heartiest manner.“Did you know me again directly, Ib?” she asked; but even afterwards,when they were left quite by themselves, and he stood there stillholding her hand in his, he could only say:“You look quite like a real lady, and I am so uncouth. How often Ihave thought of you, Christine, and of the old times!”And arm in arm they sauntered up the great ridge, and looked acrossthe stream towards the heath, towards the great hills overgrown withbloom. It was perfectly silent; but by the time they parted it hadgrown quite clear to him that Christine must be his wife. Had theynot, even in their childhood, been called the betrothed pair? To himthey seemed to be really engaged to each other, though neither of themhad spoken a word on the subject. Only for a few more hours could theyremain together, for Christine was obliged to go back into the nextvillage, from whence the carriage was to start early next morning forHerning. Her father and Ib escorted her as far as the village. It wasa fair moonlight evening, and when they reached their destination, andIb still held Christine’s hand in his own, he could not make up hismind to let her go. His eyes brightened, but still the words camehalting over his lips. Yet they came from the depths of his heart,when he said:“If you have not become too grand, Christine, and if you can make upyour mind to live with me in my mother’s house as my wife, we mustbecome a wedded pair some day; but we can wait awhile yet.”“Yes, let us wait for a time, Ib,” she replied; and he kissed herlips. “I confide in you, Ib,” said Christine; “and I think that I loveyou–but I will sleep upon it.”And with that they parted. And on the way home Ib told the boatmanthat he and Christine were as good as betrothed; and the boatmandeclared he had always expected it would turn out so; and he went homewith Ib, and remained that night in the young man’s house; but nothingfurther was said of the betrothal.A year passed by, in the course of which two letters were exchangedbetween Ib and Christine. The signature was prefaced by the words,“Faithful till death!” One day the boatman came into Ib, and broughthim a greeting from Christine. What he had further to say was broughtout in somewhat hesitating fashion, but it was to the effect thatChristine was almost more than prosperous, for she was a pretty girl,courted and loved. The son of the host had been home on a visit; hewas employed in the office of some great institution in Copenhagen;and he was very much pleased with Christine, and she had taken a fancyto him: his parents were ready to give their consent, but Christinewas very anxious to retain Ib’s good opinion; “and so she had thoughtof refusing this great piece of good fortune,” said the boatman.At first Ib said not a word; but he became as white as the wall, andslightly shook his head. Then he said slowly:“Christine must not refuse this advantageous offer.”“Then do you write a few words to her,” said the boatman.And Ib sat down to write; but he could not manage it well: the wordswould not come as he wished them; and first he altered, and then hetore up the page; but the next morning a letter lay ready to be sentto Christine, and it contained the following words: “I have read the letter you have sent to your father, andgather from it that you are prospering in all things, andthat there is a prospect of higher fortune for you. Ask yourheart, Christine, and ponder well the fate that awaits you,if you take me for your husband; what I possess is butlittle. Do not think of me, or my position, but think ofyour own welfare. You are bound to me by no promise, and ifin your heart you have given me one, I release you from it.May all treasures of happiness be poured out upon you,Christine. Heaven will console me in its own good time. “Ever your sincere friend,And the letter was dispatched, and Christine duly received it.In the course of that November her banns were published in the churchon the heath, and in Copenhagen, where her bridegroom lived; and toCopenhagen she proceeded, under the protection of her futuremother-in-law, because the bridegroom could not undertake the journeyinto Jutland on account of his various occupations. On the journey,Christine met her father in a certain village; and here the two tookleave of one another. A few words were mentioned concerning this fact,but Ib made no remark upon it: his mother said he had grown verysilent of late; indeed, he had become very pensive, and thus the threenuts came into his mind which the gipsy-woman had given him long ago,and of which he had given two to Christine. Yes, it seemed right–theywere wishing-nuts, and in one of them lay a golden carriage with twohorses, and in the other very elegant clothes; all those luxurieswould now be Christine’s in the capital. Her part had thus come true.And to him, Ib, the nut had offered only black earth. The gipsy-womanhad said, this was “the best of all for him.” Yes, it was right, thatalso was coming true. The black earth was the best for him. Now heunderstood clearly what had been the woman’s meaning. In the blackearth, in the dark grave, would be the best happiness for him.And once again years passed by, not very many, but they seemed longyears to Ib. The old innkeeper and his wife died, one after the other;the whole of their property, many thousands of dollars, came to theson. Yes, now Christine could have the golden carriage, and plenty offine clothes.During the two long years that followed no letter came from Christine;and when her father at length received one from her, it was notwritten in prosperity, by any means. Poor Christine! neither she norher husband had understood how to keep the money together; and thereseemed to be no blessing with it, because they had not sought it.And again the weather bloomed and faded. The winter had swept for manyyears across the heath, and over the ridge beneath which Ib dwelt,sheltered from the rough winds. The spring sun shone bright, and Ibguided the plough across his field, when one day it glided over whatappeared to be a fire stone. Something like a great black ship cameout of the ground, and when Ib took it up it proved to be a piece ofmetal; and the place from which the plough had cut the stone gleamedbrightly with ore. It was a great golden armlet of ancient workmanshipthat he had found. He had disturbed a “Hun’s Grave,” and discoveredthe costly treasure buried in it. Ib showed what he had found to theclergyman, who explained its value to him, and then he betook himselfto the local judges, who reported the discovery to the keeper of themuseum, and recommended Ib to deliver up the treasure in person.“You have found in the earth the best thing you could find,” said thejudge.“The best thing!” thought Ib. “The very best thing for me, and foundin the earth! Well, if that is the best, the gipsy-woman was correctin what she prophesied to me.”So Ib travelled with the ferry-boat from Aarhus to Copenhagen. To him,who had but once or twice passed beyond the river that rolled by hishome, this seemed like a voyage across the ocean. And he arrived inCopenhagen.The value of the gold he had found was paid over to him; it was alarge sum–six hundred dollars. And Ib of the heath wandered about inthe great capital.On the day on which he had settled to go back with the captain, Iblost his way in the streets, and took quite a different direction fromthe one he intended to follow. He had wandered into the suburb ofChristianhaven, into a poor little street. Not a human being was to beseen. At last a very little girl came out of one of the wretchedhouses. Ib inquired of the little one the way to the street which hewanted; but she looked shyly at him, and began to cry bitterly. Heasked her what ailed her, but could not understand what she said inreply. But as they went along the street together, they passed beneaththe light of a lamp; and when the light fell on the girl’s face, hefelt a strange and sharp emotion, for Christine stood bodily beforehim, just as he remembered her from the days of his childhood.And he went with the little maiden into the wretched house, andascended the narrow, crazy staircase, which led to a little atticchamber in the roof. The air in this chamber was heavy and almostsuffocating: no light was burning; but there was heavy sighing andmoaning in one corner. Ib struck a light with the help of a match. Itwas the mother of the child who lay sighing on the miserable bed.“Can I be of any service to you?” asked Ib. “This little girl hasbrought me up here, but I am a stranger in this city. Are there noneighbours or friends whom I could call to you?” And he raised thesick woman’s head, and smoothed her pillow.It was Christine of the heath!For years her name had not been mentioned yonder, for the mention ofher would have disturbed Ib’s peace of mind, and rumour had toldnothing good concerning her. The wealth which her husband hadinherited from his parents had made him proud and arrogant. He hadgiven up his certain appointment, had travelled for half a year inforeign lands, and on his return had incurred debts, and yet lived inan expensive fashion. His carriage had bent over more and more, so tospeak, until at last it turned over completely. The many merrycompanions and table-friends he had entertained declared it served himright, for he had kept house like a madman; and one morning his corpsewas found in the canal.The icy hand of death was already on Christine. Her youngest child,only a few weeks old, expected in prosperity and born in misery, wasalready in its grave, and it had come to this with Christine herself,that she lay, sick to death and forsaken, in a miserable room, amid apoverty that she might well have borne in her childish days, but whichnow oppressed her painfully, since she had been accustomed to betterthings. It was her eldest child, also a little Christine, that heresuffered hunger and poverty with her, and whom Ib had now broughthome.“I am unhappy at the thought of dying and leaving the poor child herealone,” she said. “Ah, what is to become of the poor thing?” And not aword more could she utter.And Ib brought out another match, and lighted up a piece of candle hefound in the room, and the flame illumined the wretched dwelling. AndIb looked at the little girl, and thought how Christine had lookedwhen she was young; and he felt that for her sake he would be fond ofthis child, which was as yet a stranger to him. The dying woman gazedat him, and her eyes opened wider and wider–did she recognize him? Henever knew, for no further word passed over her lips.And it was in the forest by the river Gudenau, in the region of theheath. The air was thick and dark, and there were no blossoms on theheath plant; but the autumn tempests whirled the yellow leaves fromthe wood into the stream, and out over the heath towards the hut ofthe boatman, in which strangers now dwelt; but beneath the ridge, safebeneath the protection of the high trees, stood the little farm,trimly whitewashed and painted, and within it the turf blazed upcheerily in the chimney; for within was sunlight, the beaming sunlightof a child’s two eyes; and the tones of the spring birds sounded inthe words that came from the child’s rosy lips: she sat on Ib’s knee,and Ib was to her both father and mother, for her own parents weredead, and had vanished from her as a dream vanishes alike fromchildren and grown men. Ib sat in the pretty neat house, for he was aprosperous man, while the mother of the little girl rested in thechurchyard at Copenhagen, where she had died in poverty.Ib had money, and was said to have provided for the future. He had wongold out of the black earth, and he had a Christine for his own, afterall..
