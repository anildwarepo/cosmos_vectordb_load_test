wine_Leonetti_Cellar_2014_Reserve_Red_(Walla_Walla_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 129559.
country: US.
description: This wine is a blend of 79% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Malbec and 8% Petit Verdot from Seven Hills, Loess, Mill Creek Upland and Serra Pedace vineyards. Aromas of fresh herbs, scorched earth, mineral, and red and black fruit—slightly dried-out-seeming—lead to a silky textured concentrated palate. The tannins are there but are beautifully integrated. It shows plenty of hang time on the finish. It should have a good 15 years in front of it. Best from 2024–2030..
