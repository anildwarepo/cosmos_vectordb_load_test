Description: Eleven Devious, Shocking Stories from the Master of the Unpredictable. What could go wrong when a wife pawns the mink coat that her lover gave her as a parting gift? What happens when a pricelass piece of furniture is the subject of a deceitful bargain? Can a wronged woman take revenge on her dead husband? In these dark, dangerous stories Roald Dahl explores the sinister side of human nature: the cunning, sly, selfish part of each of us that leads into the territory of the unexpected and unsettling. Stylish, macabre and haunting, these tales will leave you with a delicious feeling of unease..
