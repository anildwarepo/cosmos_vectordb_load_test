Description: Take three of the leading names in contemporary horror writing, commission one-third of a book's worth of stories from each, and the result is DARK VISIONS. Stephen King leads off with three stories, including ""Sneakers"", about a very unusual haunting, and ""Dedication"", one of the most powerful and unsettling of all his works. Dan Simmons pays homage to Philip K Dick with ""Metastasis"", one of three highly accomplished stories. And George Martin rounds off the book with the brilliant werewolf novella, ""The Skin Trade"". DARK VISIONS is a brilliantly original showcase from three masters of the macabre..
