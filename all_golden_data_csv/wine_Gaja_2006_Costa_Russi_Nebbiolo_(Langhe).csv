description: Purchased by the Gaja family in 1967, the Costa Russi vineyard produces elegant expressions of Nebbiolo with beautifully saturated, sun-drenched flavors. Indeed, this vintage shows wild berry with beautiful background renderings of smoke and graphite. Five percent Barbera is added and the wine shows amazing harmony and sophistication with bright acidity and firm tannins. It will only become more beautiful in time..
