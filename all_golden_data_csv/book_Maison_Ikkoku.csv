Description: From the creator of RANMA 1/2 and INUYASHA comes one of Rumiko Takahashi's most beloved series, the romantic (sort of) comedy MAISON IKKOKU, re-presented in a second edition in its original episodic order, with a ""missing"" episode! Take a trip down memory lane back into Japan's nuttiest apartment house and meet its volatile inhabitants: Kyoko, the beautiful and mysterious new apartment manager; Yusaku, the exam-addled college student; Mrs. Ichinose, the drunken gossip; Kentaro, her bratty son; Akemi, the boozy bar hostess who runs around the house in flimsy lingerie; and the mooching and peeping Mr. Yotsuya..
