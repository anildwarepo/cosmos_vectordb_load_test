country: US.
description: Girard's recent Petite Sirahs have been great, really defining a Napa approach to the variety, and their 2010 is right up there. It's fairly high in alcohol, but there's no trace of overripeness. You'll find delicious blackberry jam, black currant, grilled bacon and black pepper flavors that finish dry, spicy and above all, satisfying. Wonderful now, but it should easily negotiate the next 10 years in the bottle..
