He must venture into perilous lands with a strange band of fellow travellers - one of whom is hatching his own sinister plot. THE ELF QUEEN OF SHANNARA - Ordered by the Druid Allanon to find the Elves and return them to the world of Men, Wren is taken to an island where they might still exist. Even if by some miracle she locates the Elves, will they follow her? THE TALISMANS OF SHANNARA - The Shadowen still swarm over the Four Lands, poisoning everything with their dark magic.
