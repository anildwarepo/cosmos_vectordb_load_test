wine_Betz_Family_2012_Le_Parrain_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Red_Mountain),"Unnamed: 0: 110034.
country: US.
description: A rare reserve-level Cabernet only made once before, this 100% varietal wine hails from esteemed Kiona and Ciel du Cheval vineyards. Char and dark roasted coffee aromas meld with notes of herbs, spice and black fruit. The flavors are dense, layered and concentrated, but also show finesse and detail, with the palate broadening out considerably over time. The tannins are polished but still tightly wound and will benefit from an extended period in the cellar. Best from 2022 to 2028 but has the stuffing to get there and beyond..
