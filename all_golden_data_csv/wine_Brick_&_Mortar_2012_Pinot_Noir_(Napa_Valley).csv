country: US.
description: This producer is honing in on the unconventional, sourcing Pinot Noir grapes from unlikely Napa Valley spots like Spring Mountain and Atlas Peak. The resulting wines are surprising and unpredictable in their complexity of savory blithe spirit, light and clear with edgy red cherry and tea, plenty structured, with lurking tannin. The floral aspect on the nose is compelling, as is the cardamon finish..
