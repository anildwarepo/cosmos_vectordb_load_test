description: While this bottling is always interesting, it is dependent on vintage conditions. This bottling, from the excellent 2012 harvest, is Windstream's best ever, a provocative example of a cool-climate Pinot from a fine vineyard in an excellent year. It's bone dry, tart in acidity and hugely complex, offering layers of raspberry sour candy, cherry-pie filling, persimmons, tobacco spices and just a touch of smoky oak. The mouthfeel is silky and delightful. As good as this wine is, give it at least until 2018 to develop further..
