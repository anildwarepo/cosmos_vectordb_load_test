country: US.
description: This own-rooted block is usually blended into Peter Hunken's larger bottling, but this extra-special vintage thankfully got its own stage. Dense boysenberry, black peppercorns, asphalt, charred lamb, dried violets, lilacs and lavender show on the tarry yet floral nose. The palate is zesty with acidity but deep with flavor, offering thyme, soy, rosemary and more peppercorns. It's ideal for a lamb or game dish..
