description: Winemaker Bill Brousseau works to restrain the powerful ripeness that can come from one of the more famous vineyards in the appellation. This offers a nose with wound-up cranberry fruit, touches of hibiscus and rosebuds, and chipped-slate aromas. The palate shows juniper and pine-needle spice across a juicy black-cherry and black-plum core, with strong acidity and solid structure extending into a savory finish..
