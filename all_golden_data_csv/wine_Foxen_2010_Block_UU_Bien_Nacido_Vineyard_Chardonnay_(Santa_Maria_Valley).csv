description: You want decadence, opulence and fabulosity in your Chardonnay? This one's for you. It's tremendous in ripe pineapple, pear, peach, mango, lime, tangerine and papaya flavors. So much fruit, while the oak application is never heavy handed, applying just the right touch of buttered toast. Where does all that vanilla honey come from? A magnificent example of a first-growth California Chardonnay, at a great price..
