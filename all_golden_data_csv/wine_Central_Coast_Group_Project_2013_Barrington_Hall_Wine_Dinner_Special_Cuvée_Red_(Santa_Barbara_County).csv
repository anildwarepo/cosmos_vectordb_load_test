country: US.
description: Scott Sampler is employing some avant-garde techniques in his winemaking, including extra long macerations, but this blend of 50% Grenache, 25% Mourvèdre and 25% Syrah is relatively straightforward. Aromas of stewed blackberry and red currant meet with licorice spice and a leathery richness on the nose. The palate shows black raspberry, vanilla dust, gingerbread and minty tarragon, laid upon a still-tight texture with lively acidity..
