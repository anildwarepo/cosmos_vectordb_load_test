country: France.
description: A touch of funkiness hovers over fresh pear notes. The palate then offers fresh-faced, tart and ripe pear notes, etched with citrus freshness for extra precision and purity. This is so inviting and disarming, it is a joy to savor. Despite the generously ripe fruit, a coolness runs through this, anchoring the flavors in freshness and drive. Simply delicious and so balanced, so you can enjoy it now, though it will cellar well through 2027..
