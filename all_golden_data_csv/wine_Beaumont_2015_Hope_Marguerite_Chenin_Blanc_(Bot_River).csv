country: South Africa.
description: Beaumont's Hope Marguerite is always a stunner. The 2015 bottling opens with forward fynbos and baking-spice aromas that are supported by notes of red apple, orange blossom and fennel. The medium-weight mouthfeel boasts rich flavors of spiced citrus and apple pie, with waves of toasted spice and honeyed almond dancing through the long, evolving finish. It's a complex wine that should drink well through 2022..
