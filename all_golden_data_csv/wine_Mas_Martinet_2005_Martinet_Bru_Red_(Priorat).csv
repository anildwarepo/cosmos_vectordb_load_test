country: Spain.
description: One can make the argument that in 2005, Martinet Bru, Mas Martinet's “second” wine, is every bit as good and quite a bit more approachable than Clos Martinet. This wine is entirely solid and free of holes. It shows deep, ripe cassis and berry flavors along with chocolaty richness and accents of sage and herbs. Drink now through 2012. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines..
