country: Argentina.
description: Until now, Tapiz has been a value-driven brand with no wine priced above $20. This outstanding Malbec shows that they've been holding something back. Black Tears is ripe and handsome, with almost everything in its perfect place. It's a hard-driving wine with blackberry, vanilla and coconut aromas and flavors in front of a chewy, tannin-rich finish with the mildest note of raisin. Drink this unbridled stud now through 2017..
