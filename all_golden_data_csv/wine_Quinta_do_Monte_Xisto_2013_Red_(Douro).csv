country: Portugal.
description: This is an impressive, powerful wine. It speaks of the hard landscape of the Douro Superior, with its structure and dark tannins. At the same time, ripe dark fruits push through the still-young tannins giving the potential for a rich, black fruit dominated wine. Predominantly Touriga Nacional (60 percent), this wine is a new venture created by Jo√£o Nicolau d'Almeida (who has run Ramos-Pinto for many years) and his family. Drink from 2018..
