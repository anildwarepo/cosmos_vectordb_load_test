country: US.
description: This Bordeaux-style blend—60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Merlot and 6% Cab Franc—comes from Pepper Bridge, Seven Hills and McClellan vineyard fruit. Round and approachable, it puts the sweet and tangy flavors of cherry and berry front and center, yet has the structure to age for up to a decade. These are the oldest blocks of fruit that Saviah uses, and this, says winemaker Rich Funk, stands as the winery's signature wine..
