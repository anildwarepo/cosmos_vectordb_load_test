country: US.
description: Cabernet specialist Venge brings its vision of big, bold wines to Chardonnay, with mixed results. The wine is huge and fruity, with massive pineapple, pear, crème brûlée, buttered toast, caramel and vanilla spice flavors, in which oak obviously plays a part. Yet it's almost too much of a good thing. It earns its high score for sheer power, but you find yourself wanting greater subtlely and finesse..
