country: US.
description: There has been an impressive jump in quality over the past few vintages, along with a price drop. What's not to like? This young, lightly spritzy wine is a fresh summer drink with immense appeal. Scents of white flowers, flavors of pears and highlights of tangerines, continue into further flavors of pink grapefruit and clean rock. The low alcohol suggests that there is a touch of residual sugar, but the wine finishes dry..
