country: US.
description: Named after the winemaker's newborn son, Enzo is a bold unabashedly unique take on Finger Lakes Riesling in the hands of a Long Island producer. Made from grapes frozen on the vine and fermented via indigenous yeast in French oak, it's intensely spicy, wafting of caramel and candied orange rinds. The palate is unctuously honeyed but dusted by layers of earth and mineral. It's a far departure from a classic ice wine yet intriguingly complex and impeccably balanced..
