country: US.
description: A mix of Pinot Gris, Müller-Thurgau, Riesling and more, this all-purpose white wine shows a steady hand at the blending table. Nothing dominates, but it seems as if the best of each component is showcased. Ripe forward pineapple and white peach fruit, lively spice and a sappy acid-driven finish all come into focus. If the standard varietal white wine options are feeling a bit boring, this may help to reinvigorate your palate..
