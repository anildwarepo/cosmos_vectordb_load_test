wine_Waters_2014_Merlot_(Washington),"Unnamed: 0: 42734.
country: US.
description: The winery's first varietal Merlot is a blend of fruit from the Canoe Ridge, Stone Tree and Cold Creek vineyards. The aromas are locked up at present with notes of dark fruit, crushed flowers and spice that lead to ripe, plush fruit flavors backed by a firm spine of tannins that need time to unwind. It's the most unabashedly forward wine this winery has made to date. Give it plenty of time to open up; it delivers..
