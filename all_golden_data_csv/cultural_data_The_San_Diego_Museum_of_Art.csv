First Page Reviews: Counter intuitive.  Less info than the very basic wall placards.  No useful search function The pop-up ads were too obtrusive. I couldn't even read a single description of a painting without being interrupted with a coupon for 10% off at the gift shop. Used 2 gb of data in four hours, but great content. I really loved the content,  and the app worked fine on my Sony Xperia on t mobile. Well written and informative. But it used 2 gb of data in a four hour trip. It used all of my data for the month in one visit. That is a broken and unusable app for anyone on a data budget. Be careful with this app. ...Full ReviewI really loved the content,  and the app worked fine on my Sony Xperia on t mobile. Well written and informative. But it used 2 gb of data in a four hour trip. It used all of my data for the month in one visit. That is a broken and unusable app for anyone on a data budget. Be careful with this app. I'm going to ask the company that makes this app for the thirty dollars it costs to upgrade my data use for this month.  Edit: contacted guru and they were great about tech support. T mobile reversed the issue. Won't open on Nexus 6P App crashes before opening. Need to be reviewed..
