title: The Bat and the Two Weasels.
text: A blundering bat once stuck her headInto a wakeful weasel’s bed;Whereat the mistress of the house,A deadly foe of rats and mice,Was making ready in a triceTo eat the stranger as a mouse.“What! do you dare,” she said, “to creep inThe very bed I sometimes sleep in,Now, after all the provocationI’ve suffered from your thievish nation?Are you not really a mouse,That gnawing pest of every house,Your special aim to do the cheese ill?Ay, that you are, or I’m no weasel.”“I beg your pardon,” said the bat;“My kind is very far from that.What! I a mouse! Who told you such a lie?Why, ma’am, I am a bird;And, if you doubt my word,Just see the wings with which I fly.Long live the mice that cleave the sky!”These reasons had so fair a show,The weasel let the creature go.By some strange fancy led,The same wise blunderhead,But two or three days later,Had chosen for her restAnother weasel’s nest,This last, of birds a special hater.New peril brought this step absurd:Without a moment’s thought or puzzle,Dame weasel opened her peaked muzzleTo eat th’ intruder as a bird.“Hold! do not wrong me,” cried the bat;“I’m truly no such thing as that.Your eyesight strange conclusions gathers.What makes a bird, I pray? Its feathers.I’m cousin of the mice and rats.Great Jupiter confound the cats!”The bat, by such adroit replying,Twice saved herself from dying.And many a human strangerThus turns his coat in danger;And sings, as suits, where’er he goes,“God save the king!”—or “save his foes!”.
