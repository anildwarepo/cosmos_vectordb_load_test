country: US.
description: This is a blend of 92% Sauvignon Blanc and 8% SÃ©millon. It was partially barrel-fermented and then aged on the lees. It is a very great example of its genre, one of the best in memory. Shows intricate layers of Meyer lemons, kefir limes and white peaches, offset by crisp acidity and minerals but softened with buttercream and buttered toast. A vibrant, immaculate wine, one of the Sauvignon Blanc stars of the vintage..
