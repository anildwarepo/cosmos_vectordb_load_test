country: US.
description: From a vineyard and winery founded in 1996 by Judy Aron (one of the first women vintners in the region), this blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 20% Malbec and 10% Petit Verdot shows fresh aromas of black plum, blueberry, violet, lava rocks and wet cement. The tannins are polished and soft, but provide a stiff-enough backbone to hold up black-currrant flavors that are enhanced with flashes of caramel..
