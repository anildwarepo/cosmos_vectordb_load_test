wine_Goodfellow_2013_Richard's_Cuvée_Chardonnay_(Ribbon_Ridge),"Unnamed: 0: 64150.
country: US.
description: Sourced from the Whistling Ridge Vineyard, this was previously bottled under the winemaker's Matello label. It's packed with apple and pear fruit flavors, supported with ample acidity. Smooth and fleshy, its 50% new oak remains subtly integrated, with highlights of caramel and butter peeking out. It's well balanced, but you'll note that there are tartaric crystals (utterly harmless) clinging to the cork, suggesting that it was not cold stabilized. Drink soon..
