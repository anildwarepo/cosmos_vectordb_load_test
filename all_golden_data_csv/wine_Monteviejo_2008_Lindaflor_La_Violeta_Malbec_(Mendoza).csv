country: Argentina.
description: Much like the previous vintage of La Violeta, this is a fabulous Malbec with depth, density and power to spare. The bouquet yields marzipan, cola, fine leather, char and rich berry aromas. That sets up a palate with impeccable structure and huge flavors of beef jerky, mocha, black fruits and spice. The finish is massive and loaded, with licorice and mocha flavors. Drink nowâ€“2018. Only 100 cases made, with 50 imported into the U.S..
