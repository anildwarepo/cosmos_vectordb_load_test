wine_Tildio_2006_Malbec_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 75967.
country: US.
description: From Stillwater Creek vineyard, this 80/20 blend of Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon simply tastes young. The fruit is ripe enough, but superficial, with a lot of barrel flavors providing the weight and filling in with smoke, toast and coffee. Malbec has a very promising future in Washington State, and it's good to see young and talented wineries such as Tildio doing the exploration. Right now, this is just a pleasant table wine..
