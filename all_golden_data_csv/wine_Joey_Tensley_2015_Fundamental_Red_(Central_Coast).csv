wine_Joey_Tensley_2015_Fundamental_Red_(Central_Coast),"Unnamed: 0: 25544.
country: US.
description: This blend is part of a new label for Syrah master Joey Tensley, and it's actually far more accessible at this young age than his more expensive bottlings. Fascinating aromas of game, animal hide and tar meet with black currant and elderberry on the nose. There is a strong density and tannic frame to the palate, where flavors of bay leaf, thyme and pepper spice up the undercurrent of elderberry and black plum skins..
