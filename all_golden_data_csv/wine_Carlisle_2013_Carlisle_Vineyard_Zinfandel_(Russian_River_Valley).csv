country: US.
description: From a vineyard planted in 1927 and tended to by the producer, this is a bright, lushly crisp wine from a field blendâ€”soft, luxurious and smooth on the palate. The highlights are many, from a seductive leap of raspberry coulis to perfumed lavender and surprisingly nuanced tannins despite the full-bodied ripeness, accentuated by the vintage, and the structured power behind the scenes. Drink now through 2023..
