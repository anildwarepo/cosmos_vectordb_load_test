country: US.
description: This is a show-stopping blend of 71% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Petit Verdot and 9% Malbec by veteran winemaker Kevin Willenborg. A deep shade of mauve, the wine coats the glass and unleashes intense, lavish aromas of cassis, fig paste, mint and tarragon. It's as soft as it looks on the palate, where baked black cherry, roast beef, turned earth and lilac flavors ride luxurious yet firmly structured tannins..
