wine_Viader_2010_Red_(Napa_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 98549.
country: US.
description: Viader has a long history of producing great Bordeaux-style blends grown at a high elevation on Howell Mountain. This 2010 is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, with almost the same percentages as the superb 2009 bottling. The wine is rich, dry and complex. It shows a fantastic array of blackberries, dates and dark chocolate, with fascinating notes of lavender and dill. The tannins are gorgeous, the acidity fine, and the application of oak is deft. It's hard to describe just how good this wine feels in the mouth. Drink now, after decanting, or within the next 20 years..
