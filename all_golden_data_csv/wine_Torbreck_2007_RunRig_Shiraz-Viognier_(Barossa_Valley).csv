wine_Torbreck_2007_RunRig_Shiraz-Viognier_(Barossa_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 77037.
country: Australia.
description: Winemaker Dave Powell is no longer with Torbreck, but the 2007 RunRig is one of his finest efforts. The complexity is almost overwhelming, as the aromas range from peppery spice and roasted meat to blueberry and tappanade. It's mouth filling and expansive, yet retains fine acids and just the right amount of slightly dusty tannins on the long finish. Approachable now, but capable of lasting at least though 2020..
