country: Germany.
description: It's hard to find a favorite within Dr. Loosen's excellent line up of 2015 auslese, but this bottling stands out for its kaleidoscope of fruit, floral and earthen complexities. Sumptuous and ripe, fleshy white peach and grapefruit flavors undulate on the palate. It's finely framed, edged by sharp lines of slate, spine-tingling acidity and swathes of fennel and earth. The finish feels fragile, laced in sweetness and lingering..
