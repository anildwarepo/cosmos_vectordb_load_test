country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Kevin Grant. Under the Gavel is always a stunning CWG selection, and the 2016 continues to deliver. It's rich and ripe right from the start, with opulent scents of wood-grilled peach, honeydew and toasted brioche that entice and delight. The medium-weight palate is smooth and seductive, but ultimately balanced by a great cut of lemony acidity and a saline minerality that refreshes the finish. It's powerful, but not overly so, with all the elements in balance, meaning it should age gracefully through 2025..
