country: US.
description: Once again, this more affordable “younger brother” to the Mount Eden bottling competes with gusto. Including 14% Merlot, 6% Cabernet Franc, 4% Petit Verdot and 1% Malbec, it shows savory black plum, black pepper, char, leather and dried herb aromas on the nose. The palate is hearty and almost salty tasting, with beef, charred black fruit, pine resin and caramel flavors. Very satisfying and full of umami characteristics..
