country: US.
description: Right out of the chute this toasty, dark, dense, sexy wine says, “Drink me!” But some further time in bottle seems like the better plan. It's quite young, tight, still a bit awkward in the mouth, with the barrel and fruit flavors not quite integrated. All the right pieces are here—ripe black berries, cassis and cherries along with spicy herbal streaks and a whiff of coffee. Just let it all settle down before you pop the (glass) cork..
