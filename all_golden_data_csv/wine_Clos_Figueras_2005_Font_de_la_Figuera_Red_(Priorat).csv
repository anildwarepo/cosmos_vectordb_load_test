wine_Clos_Figueras_2005_Font_de_la_Figuera_Red_(Priorat),"Unnamed: 0: 99817.
country: Spain.
description: Takes time to unfold after an early blast of saucy spice, hoisin, chili powder and black fruit. The palate is forward and charged, with deep raspberry, cherry and sizzle. Typical of Priorat, there's a gritty ruggedness to the mouthfeel and heat on the finish, but it's by no means rocky. Best through 2011. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines..
