wine_Jayson_2005_Pinot_Noir_(Sonoma_Coast),"Unnamed: 0: 105194.
country: US.
description: This is the first Pinot from the Napa house of Pahlmeyer, the result of many years of effort in his vineyard in the Fort Ross area of the true Sonoma Coast. The result is rich in cherry pie, raspberry liqueur, cotton candy, licorice, vanilla and cinnamon flavors that captivate from sip one, but there's a certain young vine simple directness that limits the score. As the vines age, the wine is one to watch..
