country: South Africa.
description: A lovely dessert wine, perhaps the pinnacle in South Africa. Concentrated and quite intense with full-bodied flavors of orange rind, clementine and dried apricot fruit spiced with notes of crushed yellow florals, roasted nut skin, toasted egg bread and pure honeycomb. Balanced acidity prevents the mouth from being too thick or viscous, while the endless finish carries decadent notes of candied ginger..
