Description: Students and scholars will rejoice that the famed works of John Milton (1608-1974) now join those of Chaucer and Shakespeare in the definitive, one-volume Riverside series. Milton's early poetry is here and his important prose, but pride of place is given to his epics, PARADISE LOST and PARADISE REGAINED as well as his final masterpiece, the dramatic SAMSON AGONISTES..
