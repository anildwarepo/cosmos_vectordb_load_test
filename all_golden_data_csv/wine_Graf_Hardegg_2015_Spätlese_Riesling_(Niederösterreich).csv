country: Austria.
description: Honey and the perfumed notes of quince are immediately apparent on this Spätlese Riesling. The sweetness is carried beautifully by ripe notions of peach, additional quince and apricot coulis, balanced and countered by the fresh, ripe and pliable acidity of oranges and tangerines. This is slightly decadent and very harmonious. Perhaps sweet enough for an apricot tart but certainly a killer with salty blue cheeses. No other grape can perform the same tightrope walk as Riesling. Enjoy..
