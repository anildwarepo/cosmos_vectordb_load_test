country: US.
description: Oak tones of spice, smoke and toasted wood show prominently on this Chardonnay, juxtaposed against muted apple and pear flavors. Glimpses of pretty white floral and citrus lend freshness to the palate, amplified by zesty acidity and a sexy tinge of vanilla on the finish. Of the two bottles received for sampling, there was noticeable bottle variation with one showing signs of premature maturation. Drink now through 2019..
