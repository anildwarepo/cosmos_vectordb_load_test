country: South Africa.
description: A blend of 68% Shiraz, 18% Grenache, 10% Cinsault and 4% Tinta Barocca, this is one of the finest reds coming out of South Africa today. It is powerful and concentrated, yet elegant and refined, with notes of lush red cherry, raspberry and plum that are complemented by notes of game, pepper and fynbos. Fine yet gripping tannins and tight fruit flavors lend a solid structure to the rich mouthfeel, while notes of peppered berries and mentholated herbs linger long on the finish. Drink 2020â€“2025..
