country: Austria.
description: Yellow plum and Amalfi lemon lead a merry dance on nose and palate. A yeasty edge pulls them down to earth, but their exuberance is evident, swirling and barely contained. This is lively, refreshing and totally invigorating. A celebration of ripe citrus draws a dynamic and dizzying fault line across the palate. Currently, minerality lurks in the background while the fruit dances. This will change intriguingly with time..
