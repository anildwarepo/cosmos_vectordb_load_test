country: US.
description: Picked and vinified expressly for this rosé, the grapes were sourced from the Armada Vineyard. It has a pale, copper-like onion-skin shade, it is aged for a year longer than most rosés, but it has lost none of its freshness. The pretty strawberry note gains complexity and textural interest as it lingers on the palate. Persistent, focused, leesy and long, this elegant rosé looks deceptively light, but offers powerful flavors..
