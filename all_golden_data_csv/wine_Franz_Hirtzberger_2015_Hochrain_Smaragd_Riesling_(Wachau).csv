country: Austria.
description: Wonderfully concentrated notes of ripe mirabelle plums open up on the nose. There also is a heady lemon note. The palate is rich with the same fleshy ripe fruit but has a fault line of zesty orange at its core that provides focus and seems to illuminate clouds of ripe aromatic citrus at every turn. This shimmers with tangerine and clementine. The body is immensely concentrated but has total direction and drive. Enjoy 2020–2040..
