title: The Battle of the Rats and Weasels.
text: The weasels live, no more than cats,On terms of friendship with the rats;And, were it not that theseThrough doors contrive to squeezeToo narrow for their foes,The animals long-snoutedWould long ago have routed,And from the planet scoutedTheir race, as I suppose.One year it did betide,When they were multiplied,An army took the fieldOf rats, with spear and shield,Whose crowded ranks led onA king named Ratapon.The weasels, too, their bannerUnfurl’d in warlike manner.As Fame her trumpet sounds,The victory balanced well;Enrich’d were fallow groundsWhere slaughter’d legions fell;But by said trollop’s tattle,The loss of life in battleThinn’d most the rattish raceIn almost every place;And finally their routWas total, spite of stoutArtarpax and Psicarpax,And valiant Meridarpax,Who, cover’d o’er with dust,Long time sustain’d their hostDown sinking on the plain.Their efforts were in vain;Fate ruled that final hour,(Inexorable power!)And so the captains fledAs well as those they led;The princes perish’d all.The undistinguish’d smallIn certain holes found shelter;In crowding, helter-skelter;But the nobilityCould not go in so free,Who proudly had assumedEach one a helmet plumed;We know not, truly, whetherFor honour’s sake the feather,Or foes to strike with terror;But, truly, ’twas their error.Nor hole, nor crack, nor creviceWill let their head-gear in;While meaner rats in beviesAn easy passage win;—So that the shafts of fateDo chiefly hit the great.A feather in the capIs oft a great mishap.An equipage too grandComes often to a standWithin a narrow place.The small, whate’er the case,With ease slip through a strait,Where larger folks must wait..
