country: US.
description: The vineyard is severely vintage-dependent, with some years much better than others, but the superbly generous 2007 harvest has resulted in this delicious mountain wine. It's perfectly ripe, offering an array of blackberries, cherries and currants wrapped into beautifully mature tannins and grounded with a firm minerality. Defines the elegant concentration of a high Mayacamas Mountain Cabernet. Drink now and over the next 10 years, at least..
