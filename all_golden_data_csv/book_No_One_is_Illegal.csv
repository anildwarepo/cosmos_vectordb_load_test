Description: Countering the chorus of anti-immigrant voices, Mike Davis and Justin Akers Chacon expose the racism of anti-immigration vigilantes and put a human face on the immigrants who risk their lives to cross the border to work in the United States. |A rare combination of an author, Mike Davis is Rachel Carson and Upton Sinclair all in one.| - Susan Faludi |Davis' writing is perceptive and rigorous.| - David Montgomery, The Nation.
