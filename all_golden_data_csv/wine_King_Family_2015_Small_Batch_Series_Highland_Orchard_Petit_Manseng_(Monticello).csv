description: Tiers of aromas and flavors in this expressive wine reveal themselves like a Matryoshka doll. Wafts of dried apricot and chamomile open into tangerine peel and marmalade, then finally marzipan and ginger come forth on the nose. Concentrated flavors mimic the aromas and introduce fresh vanilla bean and hay. Racy acidity thrills, while two years in neutral French oak keeps the wine round and full-bodied. The finish is long and compelling..
