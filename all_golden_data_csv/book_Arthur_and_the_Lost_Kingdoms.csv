Description: Moffat builds up a thesis which enables him to reveal the location and identity of the real Arthur, asserting that he was not a king but a cavalry general chosen around 500AD to lead a coalition army. The key to this argument lies in place-names and their derivation, and that the lost medieval city of Roxburgh and its castle were Arthur's Camelot..
