country: France.
description: From the famous maker of Cristal comes a truly lovely, ripe bottle of bubbly, bursting with buttered, roasted nuts and lemony fruit. The Brut Premier spends a little extra time in bottle before being released. It makes for a forward, lush and just plain delicious style of Champagne rather than one that is especially complex or elegant. If anything, this bottle will put you in a boisterous mood and keep any party hardy..
