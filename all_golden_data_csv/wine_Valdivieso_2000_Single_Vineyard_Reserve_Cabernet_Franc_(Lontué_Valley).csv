country: Chile.
description: You don't hear much about Cab Franc from Chile, but this is one that is worth seeking out. The aromas are spicy and attractive, even if there's some lemony oak masking the fruit. In the mouth, raspberry, red cherry and red apple run the show, and then comes a fresh, lithe, balanced finish. Everything is generally in place here, including some bright, refreshing acidity. Only the heavy oak dulls it down a touch. Best Buy..
