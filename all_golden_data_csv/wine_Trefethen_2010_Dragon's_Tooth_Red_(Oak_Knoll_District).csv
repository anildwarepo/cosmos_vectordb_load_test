wine_Trefethen_2010_Dragon's_Tooth_Red_(Oak_Knoll_District),"Unnamed: 0: 119944.
country: US.
description: It doesn't say so on the label, but the grapes come from the estate vineyard in Oak Knoll. It's a moderately cool AVA already, so combined with the chilly vintage, a dry wine with considerable tannins was produced. They're old-fashioned in their astringency, but the ultrarich black currant and dark chocolate flavors, boosted by high alcohol, are thoroughly modern. Made up of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. Hold until at least 2018..
