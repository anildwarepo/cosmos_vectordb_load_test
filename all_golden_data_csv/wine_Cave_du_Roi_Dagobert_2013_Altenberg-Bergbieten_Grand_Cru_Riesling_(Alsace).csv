country: France.
description: A touch of evolution is immediately apparent: that chamomile lift and dried citrus peel nose gives it away. The  dry palate then serves up notions of ripe but tart apple, incisive lemon freshness and a more generous, fluid rich texture that play off each other beautifully. On the finish it is the lemon that shines, alongside some notions of candle wax and more chamomile. A lovely snapshot of a Riesling on its trajectory. Drink 2017-2027..
