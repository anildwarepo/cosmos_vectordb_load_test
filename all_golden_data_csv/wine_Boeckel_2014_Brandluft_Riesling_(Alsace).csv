country: France.
description: Subdued, riper fruit has not yet come to the surface. Notions of Bramley apple are evoked on the nose; on the palate they show as the more rounded flavor of baked Bramley. Hovering above it all is grated lemon zest, pulling fruit, texture and freshness tautly together in a dry, fresh yet mellow finish. The more you taste, the more the still-underlying fruit yearns to rise to the surface. Best to give this some time so it can show its true, exciting colours..
