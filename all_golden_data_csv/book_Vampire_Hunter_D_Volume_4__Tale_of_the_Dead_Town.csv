Description: When a floating city becomes the target of a rash of vampire attacks, only one man can restore the oasis. ""The City,"" a tiny metropolis of a few hundred sheltered citizens floating serenely on a seemingly random course a few feet above the ground, has long been thought safe from the predation of marauding monsters. It seemed like a paradise. A paradise shattered when an invasion of apparent vampires threatens the small haven. While the Vampire Hunter known only as ""D"" struggles to exterminate the scourge, a former denizen of the city, the attractive Raleigh Knight, and the brash John M. Brassalli Pluto VIII seize control of the city lurching it onto a new and deadly course. D's travails are just beginning. * The Vampire Hunter D films are two of the most-popular Japanese anime films released in the United States consistently ranking among the top DVDs sold on amazon.com!
