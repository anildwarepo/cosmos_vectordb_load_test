country: US.
description: Very smooth, yet mouth-drying with firm tannins, this Cabernet is a bit lean, but it defines the elegance that Napa is capable of. The blackberry and currant flavors are balanced by earthier notes of green olives, cola and dried herbs, while the oak is subtle, even though it's all new. Grows more interesting as it warms in the glass, and the alcohol level is a moderate 13.6%. Blended from all five classic Bordeaux varieties, it will improve in the bottle over the next eight years..
