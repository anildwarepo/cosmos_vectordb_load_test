wine_Montes_2006_Folly_Syrah_(Santa_Cruz),"Unnamed: 0: 25013.
country: Chile.
description: Montes Folly is the benchmark by which all other Chilean Syrahs must measure themselves. Yes, it's entirely New World in its approach, but how can you gripe about such a potent brew of balsam wood, tanned leather, licorice, mineral and monster black fruit? The palate is big but balanced by live-wire acidity, and even at 15% alcohol it's harmonious. A real winner; one of the best Folly wines to date..
