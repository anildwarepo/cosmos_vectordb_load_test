country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Niels Verburg. This Shiraz-based blend, with 9% Cabernet Sauvignon, is big and bold. It opens with dark, brooding aromas of cassis, blackberry and boysenberry that are spiced by leather, licorice and gamy tones. Firm tannins and dense, concentrated black-fruit flavors yield a firm and powerful mouthfeel, while notes of leather, cigar box and cocoa linger long on the spicy finish. It's a beast that's best not disturbed now; try after 2019 and through 2025..
