country: Austria.
description: The heady, pure perfume of fig rind and foliage streams from the glass. A more tart and tropical note of passion fruit pitches in as well, along with green grapefruit spice. The aromatic spectrum is a sublimation of exotic fruit on nose and palate. The palate sustains this high-pitched balance by the purest lightening strike of zesty acidity. Even the tiniest drop of this amber liquid has the power to perfume the entire palate for minutes. The concentration is immense, the flavors are mind-boggling. This is high-octane stuff guaranteed to blow your mind. Drink now or cellar it through 2040 at least..
