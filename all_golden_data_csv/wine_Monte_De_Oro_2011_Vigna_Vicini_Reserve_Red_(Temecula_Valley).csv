country: US.
description: This 50-50 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah comes from adjacent blocks planted in 2002. It was aged in new French oak for 42 months, so the nose delivers rich aromas of sugar plum, gingerbread spice and black-cherry syrup. The palate is quite dry, with a dark-chocolate bitterness, woody juniper flavors and firm, structured tannins that give depth to the black-plum core and vanilla-pie-crust touch on the finish..
