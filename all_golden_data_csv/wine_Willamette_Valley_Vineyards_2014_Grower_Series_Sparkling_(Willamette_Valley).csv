country: US.
description: A first-ever sparkling wine from this popular producer, it's a yeasty, toasty, rather thick 50-50 mix of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. The grapes were fermented dry down to barely 11% alcohol, yet there's a heaviness to the palate that fights against the elegance characteristic of most sparkling wines. Pineapple and grapefruit are the dominant fruit flavors. Young and acidic, this will cellar well for many years..
