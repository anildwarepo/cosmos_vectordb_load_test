title: The Wind tells about Waldemar Daa and his Daughters.
text: When the wind sweeps across the grass, the field has a ripple like a pond, and when it sweeps across the corn the field waves to and fro like a high sea. That is called the wind’s dance; but the wind does not dance only, he also tells stories; and how loudly he can sing out of his deep chest, and how different it sounds in the tree-tops in the forest, and through the loopholes and clefts and cracks in walls! Do you see how the wind drives the clouds up yonder, like a frightened flock of sheep? Do you hear how the wind howls down here through the open valley, like a watchman blowing his horn? With wonderful tones hewhistles and screams down the chimney and into the fireplace. The fire crackles and flares up, and shines far into the room, and the little place is warm and snug, and it is pleasant to sit there listening to the sounds. Let the wind speak, for he knows plenty of stories and fairy tales, many more than are known to any of us. Just hear what the wind can tell.Huh–uh–ush! roar along! That is the burden of the song.“By the shores of the Great Belt, one of the straits that unite the Cattegut with the Baltic, lies an old mansion with thick red walls,”says the Wind. “I know every stone in it; I saw it when it still belonged to the castle of Marsk Stig on the promontory. But it had to be pulled down, and the stone was used again for the walls of a new mansion in another place, the baronial mansion of Borreby, which stillstands by the coast.“I knew them, the noble lords and ladies, the changing races thatdwelt there, and now I’m going to tell about Waldemar Daa and hisdaughters. How proudly he carried himself–he was of royal blood! Hecould do more than merely hunt the stag and empty the wine-can. ‘It_shall_ be done,’ he was accustomed to say.“His wife walked proudly in gold-embroidered garments over thepolished marble floors. The tapestries were gorgeous, the furniturewas expensive and artistically carved. She had brought gold and silverplate with her into the house, and there was German beer in thecellar. Black fiery horses neighed in the stables. There was a wealthylook about the house of Borreby at that time, when wealth was still athome there.“Four children dwelt there also; three delicate maidens, Ida, Joanna,and Anna Dorothea: I have never forgotten their names.“They were rich people, noble people, born in affluence, nurtured inaffluence.“Huh–sh! roar along!” sang the Wind; and then he continued:“I did not see here, as in other great noble houses, the high-bornlady sitting among her women in the great hall turning thespinning-wheel: here she swept the sounding chords of the cithern, andsang to the sound, but not always old Danish melodies, but songs of astrange land. It was ‘live and let live’ here: stranger guests camefrom far and near, the music sounded, the goblets clashed, and I wasnot able to drown the noise,” said the Wind. “Ostentation, andhaughtiness, and splendour, and display, and rule were there, but thefear of the Lord was not there.“And it was just on the evening of the first day of May,” the Windcontinued. “I came from the west, and had seen how the ships werebeing crushed by the waves, with all on board, and flung on the westcoast of Jutland. I had hurried across the heath, and over Jutland’swood-girt eastern coast, and over the Island of Fünen, and now I droveover the Great Belt, groaning and sighing.“Then I lay down to rest on the shore of Seeland, in the neighbourhoodof the great house of Borreby, where the forest, the splendid oakforest, still rose.“The young men-servants of the neighbourhood were collecting branchesand brushwood under the oak trees; the largest and driest they couldfind they carried into the village, and piled them up in a heap, andset them on fire; and men and maids danced, singing in a circle roundthe blazing pile.“I lay quite quiet,” continued the Wind; “but I silently touched abranch, which had been brought by the handsomest of the men-servants,and the wood blazed up brightly, blazed up higher than all the rest;and now he was the chosen one, and bore the name the Street-goat, andmight choose his Street-lamb first from among the maids; and there wasmirth and rejoicing, greater than I had ever heard before in the hallsof the rich baronial mansion.“And the noble lady drove towards the baronial mansion, with her threedaughters, in a gilded carriage drawn by six horses. The daughterswere young and fair–three charming blossoms, rose, lily, and palehyacinth. The mother was a proud tulip, and never acknowledged thesalutation of one of the men or maids who paused in their sport to doher honour: the gracious lady seemed a flower that was rather stiff inthe stalk.“Rose, lily, and pale hyacinth; yes, I saw them all three! Whoselambkins will they one day become? thought I; their Street-goat willbe a gallant knight, perhaps a prince. Huh–sh! hurry along! hurryalong!“Yes, the carriage rolled on with them, and the peasant people resumedtheir dancing. They rode that summer through all the villages roundabout. But in the night, when I rose again,” said the Wind, “the verynoble lady lay down, to rise again no more: that thing came upon herwhich comes upon all–there is nothing new in that.“Waldemar Daa stood for a space silent and thoughtful. ‘The proudesttree can be bowed without being broken,’ said a voice within him. Hisdaughters wept, and all the people in the mansion wiped their eyes;but Lady Daa had driven away–and I drove away too, and rushed along,huh–sh!” said the Wind.“I returned again; I often returned again over the Island of Fünen,and the shores of the Belt, and I sat down by Borreby, by the splendidoak wood; there the heron made his nest, and wood-pigeons haunted theplace, and blue ravens, and even the black stork. It was still spring;some of them were yet sitting on their eggs, others had alreadyhatched their young. But how they flew up, how they cried! The axesounded, blow on blow: the wood was to be felled. Waldemar Daa wantedto build a noble ship, a man-of-war, a three-decker, which the kingwould be sure to buy; and therefore the wood must be felled, thelandmark of the seamen, the refuge of the birds. The hawk started upand flew away, for its nest was destroyed; the heron and all the birdsof the forest became homeless, and flew about in fear and in anger: Icould well understand how they felt. Crows and ravens croaked aloud asif in scorn. ‘Crack, crack! the nest cracks, cracks, cracks!’“Far in the interior of the wood, where the noisy swarm of labourerswere working, stood Waldemar Daa and his three daughters; and alllaughed at the wild cries of the birds; only one, the youngest, AnnaDorothea, felt grieved in her heart; and when they made preparationsto fell a tree that was almost dead, and on whose naked branches theblack stork had built his nest, whence the little storks werestretching out their heads, she begged for mercy for the littlethings, and tears came into her eyes. Therefore the tree with theblack stork’s nest was left standing. The tree was not worth speakingof.“There was a great hewing and sawing, and a three-decker was built.The architect was of low origin, but of great pride; his eyes andforehead told how clever he was, and Waldemar Daa was fond oflistening to him, and so was Waldemar’s daughter Ida, the eldest, whowas now fifteen years old; and while he built a ship for the father,he was building for himself an airy castle, into which he and Ida wereto go as a married couple–which might indeed have happened, if thecastle with stone walls, and ramparts, and moats had remained. But inspite of his wise head, the architect remained but a poor bird; and,indeed, what business has a sparrow to take part in a dance ofpeacocks? Huh–sh! I careered away, and he careered away too, for hewas not allowed to stay; and little Ida got over it, because she wasobliged to get over it.“The proud black horses were neighing in the stable; they were worthlooking at, and accordingly they _were_ looked at. The admiral, whohad been sent by the king himself to inspect the new ship and takemeasures for its purchase, spoke loudly in admiration of the beautifulhorses.“I heard all that,” said the Wind. “I accompanied the gentlementhrough the open door, and strewed blades of straw like bars of goldbefore their feet. Waldemar Daa wanted to have gold, and the admiralwished for the proud black horses, and that is why he praised them somuch; but the hint was not taken, and consequently the ship was notbought. It remained on the shore covered over with boards, a Noah’sark that never got to the water–Huh–sh! rush away! away!–and thatwas a pity.“In the winter, when the fields were covered with snow, and the waterwith large blocks of ice that I blew up on to the coast,” continuedthe Wind, “crows and ravens came, all as black as might be, greatflocks of them, and alighted on the dead, deserted, lonely ship by theshore, and croaked in hoarse accents of the wood that was no more, ofthe many pretty bird’s nests destroyed, and the little ones leftwithout a home; and all for the sake of that great bit of lumber, thatproud ship that never sailed forth.“I made the snow-flakes whirl, and the snow lay like a great lake higharound the ship, and drifted over it. I let it hear my voice, that itmight know what a storm has to say. Certainly I did my part towardsteaching it seamanship. Huh–sh! push along!“And the winter passed away; winter and summer, both passed away, andthey are still passing away, even as I pass away; as the snow whirlsalong, and the apple blossom whirls along, and the leaves fall–away!away! away! and men are passing away too!“But the daughters were still young, and little Ida was a rose, asfair to look upon as on the day when the architect saw her. I oftenseized her long brown hair, when she stood in the garden by the appletree, musing, and not heeding how I strewed blossoms on her hair, andloosened it, while she was gazing at the red sun and the golden sky,through the dark underwood and the trees of the garden.“Her sister was bright and slender as a lily. Joanna had height anddeportment, but was like her mother, rather stiff in the stalk. Shewas very fond of walking through the great hall, where hung theportraits of her ancestors. The women were painted in dresses of silkand velvet, with a tiny little hat, embroidered with pearls, on theirplaited hair. They were handsome women. The gentlemen were representedclad in steel, or in costly cloaks lined with squirrel’s skin; theywore little ruffs, and swords at their sides, but not buckled to theirhips. Where would Joanna’s picture find its place on that wall someday? and how would _he_ look, her noble lord and husband? This is whatshe thought of, and of this she spoke softly to herself. I heard it,as I swept into the long hall, and turned round to come out again.“Anna Dorothea, the pale hyacinth, a child of fourteen, was quiet andthoughtful; her great deep blue eyes had a musing look, but thechildlike smile still played around her lips: I was not able to blowit away, nor did I wish to do so.“We met in the garden, in the hollow lane, in the field and meadow;she gathered herbs and flowers which she knew would be useful to herfather in concocting the drinks and drops he distilled. Waldemar Daawas arrogant and proud, but he was also a learned man, and knew agreat deal. That was no secret, and many opinions were expressedconcerning it. In his chimney there was fire even in summer time. Hewould lock the door of his room, and for days the fire would be pokedand raked; but of this he did not talk much–the forces of nature mustbe conquered in silence; and soon he would discover the art of makingthe best thing of all–the red gold.“That is why the chimney was always smoking, therefore the flamescrackled so frequently. Yes, I was there too,” said the Wind. “Let itgo, I sang down through the chimney: it will end in smoke, air, coalsand ashes! You will burn yourself! Hu-uh-ush! drive away! drive away!But Waldemar Daa did _not_ drive it away.”“The splendid black horses in the stable–what became of them? whatbecame of the old gold and silver vessels in cupboards and chests, thecows in the fields, and the house and home itself? Yes, they may melt,may melt in the golden crucible, and yet yield no gold.“Empty grew the barns and store-rooms, the cellars and magazines. Theservants decreased in number, and the mice multiplied. Then a windowbroke, and then another, and I could get in elsewhere besides at thedoor,” said the Wind. “‘Where the chimney smokes the meal is beingcooked,’ the proverb says. But here the chimney smoked that devouredall the meals, for the sake of the red gold.“I blew through the courtyard-gate like a watchman blowing his horn,”the Wind went on, “but no watchman was there. I twirled theweathercock round on the summit of the tower, and it creaked like thesnoring of the warder, but no warder was there; only mice and ratswere there. Poverty laid the tablecloth; poverty sat in the wardrobeand in the larder; the door fell off its hinges, cracks and fissuresmade their appearance, and I went in and out at pleasure; and that ishow I know all about it.“Amid smoke and ashes, amid sorrow and sleepless nights, the hair andbeard of the master turned grey, and deep furrows showed themselvesaround his temples; his skin turned pale and yellow, as his eyeslooked greedily for the gold, the desired gold.“I blew the smoke and ashes into his face and beard: the result of hislabour was debt instead of pelf. I sung through the burst window-panesand the yawning clefts in the walls. I blew into the chests of drawersbelonging to the daughters, wherein lay the clothes that had becomefaded and threadbare from being worn over and over again. That was notthe song that had been sung at the children’s cradle. The lordly lifehad changed to a life of penury. I was the only one who rejoiced aloudin that castle,” said the Wind. “I snowed them up, and they say snowkeeps people warm. They had no wood, and the forest from which theymight have brought it was cut down. It was a biting frost. I rushed inthrough loopholes and passages, over gables and roofs, that I might bebrisk. They were lying in bed because of the cold, the three high-borndaughters; and their father was crouching under his leathern coverlet.Nothing to bite, nothing to break, no fire on the hearth–there was alife for high-born people! Huh-sh, let it go! But that is what my LordDaa could _not_ do–he could _not_ let it go.“‘After winter comes spring,’ he said. ‘After want, good times willcome: one must not lose patience; one must learn to wait! Now my houseand lands are mortgaged, it is indeed high time; and the gold willsoon come. At Easter!’“I heard how he spoke thus, looking at a spider’s web. ‘Thou cunninglittle weaver, thou dost teach me perseverance. Let them tear thy web,and thou wilt begin it again, and complete it. Let them destroy itagain, and thou wilt resolutely begin to work again–again! That iswhat we must do, and that will repay itself at last.’“It was the morning of Easter-day. The bells sounded from theneighbouring church, and the sun seemed to rejoice in the sky. Themaster had watched through the night in feverish excitement, and hadbeen melting and cooling, distilling and mixing. I heard him sighinglike a soul in despair; I heard him praying, and I noticed how he heldhis breath. The lamp was burnt out, but he did not notice it. I blewat the fire of coals, and it threw its red glow upon his ghastly whiteface, lighting it up with a glare, and his sunken eyes looked forthwildly out of their deep sockets–but they became larger and larger,as though they would burst.“Look at the alchymic glass! It glows in the crucible, red-hot, andpure and heavy! He lifted it with a trembling hand, and cried with atrembling voice, ‘Gold! gold!’“He was quite dizzy–I could have blown him down,” said the Wind; “butI only fanned the glowing coals, and accompanied him through the doorto where his daughters sat shivering. His coat was powdered withashes, and there were ashes in his beard and in his tangled hair. Hestood straight up, and held his costly treasure on high, in thebrittle glass. ‘Found, found!–Gold, gold!’ he shouted, and again heldaloft the glass to let it flash in the sunshine; but his handtrembled, and the alchymic glass fell clattering to the ground, andbroke into a thousand pieces; and the last bubble of his happiness hadburst! Hu-uh-ush! rushing away!–and I rushed away from thegold-maker’s house.“Late in autumn, when the days are short, and the mist comes andstrews cold drops upon the berries and leafless branches, I came backin fresh spirits, rushed through the air, swept the sky clear, andsnapped the dry twigs–which is certainly no great labour, but yet itmust be done. Then there was another kind of sweeping clean atWaldemar Daa’s, in the mansion of Borreby. His enemy, Owe Rainel, ofBasnäs, was there with the mortgage of the house and everything itcontained in his pocket. I drummed against the broken window-panes,beat against the old rotten doors, and whistled through cracks andrifts–huh-sh! Mr. Owe Rainel did not like staying there. Ida and AnnaDorothea wept bitterly; Joanna stood pale and proud, and bit her thumbtill it bled–but what could that avail? Owe Rainel offered to allowWaldemar Daa to remain in the mansion till the end of his life, but nothanks were given him for his offer. I listened to hear what occurred.I saw the ruined gentleman lift his head and throw it back prouderthan ever, and I rushed against the house and the old lime trees withsuch force, that one of the thickest branches broke, one that was notdecayed; and the branch remained lying at the entrance as a broomwhen any one wanted to sweep the place out: and a grand sweeping outthere was–I thought it would be so.“It was hard on that day to preserve one’s composure; but their willwas as hard as their fortune.“There was nothing they could call their own except the clothes theywore: yes, there was one thing more–the alchymist’s glass, a new onethat had lately been bought, and filled with what had been gathered upfrom the ground of the treasure which promised so much but never keptits promise. Waldemar Daa hid the glass in his bosom, and taking hisstick in his hand, the once rich gentleman passed with his daughtersout of the house of Borreby. I blew cold upon his heated cheeks, Istroked his grey beard and his long white hair, and I sang as well asI could,–‘Huh-sh! gone away! gone away!’ And that was the end of thewealth and splendour.“Ida walked on one side of the old man, and Anna Dorothea on theother. Joanna turned round at the entrance–why? Fortune would notturn because she did so. She looked at the old walls of what had oncebeen the castle of Marsk Stig, and perhaps she thought of hisdaughters:‘The eldest gave the youngest her hand.And forth they went to the far-off land.’Was she thinking of this old song? Here were three of them, and theirfather was with them too. They walked along the road on which they hadonce driven in their splendid carriage–they walked forth as beggars,with their father, and wandered out into the open field, and into amud hut, which they rented for a dollar and a half a year–into theirnew house with the empty rooms and empty vessels. Crows and magpiesfluttered above them, and cried, as if in contempt, ‘Craw! craw! outof the nest! craw! craw!’ as they had done in the wood at Borreby whenthe trees were felled.“Daa and his daughters could not help hearing it. I blew about theirears, for what use would it be that they should listen?“And they went to live in the mud hut on the open field, and I wanderedaway over moor and field, through bare bushes and leafless forests, to theopen waters, the free shores, to other lands–huh-uh-ush!–away, away! yearafter year!”And how did Waldemar Daa and his daughters prosper? The Wind tells us:“The one I saw last, yes, for the last time, was Anna Dorothea, thepale hyacinth: then she was old and bent, for it was fifty yearsafterwards. She lived longer than the rest; she knew all.“Yonder on the heath, by the Jutland town of Wiborg, stood the finenew house of the canon, built of red bricks with projecting gables;the smoke came up thickly from the chimney. The canon’s gentle ladyand her beautiful daughters sat in the bay window, and looked over thehawthorn hedge of the garden towards the brown heath. What were theylooking at? Their glances rested upon the stork’s nest without, andon the hut, which was almost falling in; the roof consisted of mossand houseleek, in so far as a roof existed there at all–the stork’snest covered the greater part of it, and that alone was in propercondition, for it was kept in order by the stork himself.“That is a house to be looked at, but not to be touched; I must dealgently with it,” said the Wind. “For the sake of the stork’s nest thehut has been allowed to stand, though it was a blot upon thelandscape. They did not like to drive the stork away, therefore theold shed was left standing, and the poor woman who dwelt in it wasallowed to stay: she had the Egyptian bird to thank for that; or wasit perchance her reward, because she had once interceded for the nestof its black brother in the forest of Borreby? At that time she, thepoor woman, was a young child, a pale hyacinth in the rich garden. Sheremembered all that right well, did Anna Dorothea.“‘Oh! oh!’ Yes, people can sigh like the wind moaning in the rushesand reeds. ‘Oh! oh!'” she sighed, “no bells sounded at thy burial,Waldemar Daa! The poor schoolboys did not even sing a psalm when theformer lord of Borreby was laid in the earth to rest! Oh, everythinghas an end, even misery. Sister Ida became the wife of a peasant. Thatwas the hardest trial that befell our father, that the husband of adaughter of his should be a miserable serf, whom the proprietor couldmount on the wooden horse for punishment! I suppose he is under theground now. And thou, Ida? Alas, alas! it is not ended yet, wretchthat I am! Grant me that I may die, kind Heaven!’“That was Anna Dorothea’s prayer in the wretched hut which was leftstanding for the sake of the stork.“I took pity on the fairest of the sisters,” said the Wind. “Hercourage was like that of a man, and in man’s clothes she took serviceas a sailor on board of a ship. She was sparing of words, and of adark countenance, but willing at her work. But she did not know how toclimb; so I blew her overboard before anybody found out that she was awoman, and according to my thinking that was well done!” said theWind.“On such an Easter morning as that on which Waldemar Daa had fanciedthat he had found the red gold, I heard the tones of a psalm under thestork’s nest, among the crumbling walls–it was Anna Dorothea’s lastsong.“There was no window, only a hole in the wall. The sun rose up like amass of gold, and looked through. What a splendour he diffused! Hereyes were breaking, and her heart was breaking–but that they wouldhave done, even if the sun had not shone that morning on AnnaDorothea.“The stork covered her hut till her death. I sang at her grave!” saidthe Wind. “I sang at her father’s grave; I know where his grave is,and where hers is, and nobody else knows it.“New times, changed times! The old high-road now runs throughcultivated fields; the new road winds among the trim ditches, and soonthe railway will come with its train of carriages, and rush over thegraves which are forgotten like the names–hu-ush! passed away, passedaway!“That is the story of Waldemar Daa and his daughters. Tell it better,any of you, if you know how,” said the Wind, and turned away–and hewas gone..
