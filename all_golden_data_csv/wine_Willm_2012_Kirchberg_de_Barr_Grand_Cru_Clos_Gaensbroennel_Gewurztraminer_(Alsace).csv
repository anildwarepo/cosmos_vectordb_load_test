country: France.
description: A funky smoky notion of yeast clings to the nose on which a pure lemon streak becomes apparent. A generous, luscious and almost creamy sweetness then conquers the palate, boosting all of the fruit flavors, wrapping them in its creamy mellow embrace. The pure lemon streak counters and brightens the richness and around the edges there is grapefruit spice. This is all rather beguiling but not overdone. The finish is moreish, medium sweet and long..
