description: There's a delicious approachability to this Zinfandel that makes it drinkable now despite having some formidable Howell Mountain tannins. In that, it calls to mind the wonderful 2008. The flavors are enormously concentrated, with notes of blackberry, black currant, cured meat, black pepper and baking spice, lending terrific complexity that changes in the glass with every sip. It displays Zinfandel's wild, brambly character while preserving Napa's elegance and balance..
