country: US.
description: Made from Moscato Giallo grapes harvested late though still at low Brix, this is meant to serve as a dessert wine as it is slightly sweet, with 78 g/L of residual sugar. The aromas are pure and fully expressive of jasmine in bloom followed by apricot and honey. Light in alcohol, it shows a slight sweetness in the midpalate. Otherwise, it finishes dry, making it serviceable as an ap√©ritif or midday-in-the-garden wine..
