description: This bottling is the winery's most expensive wine, and usually its best. Production of the '08 was unusually low, resulting in amazing concentration. It's basically a detonation of cherries, raspberries, currants, cola and mocha. New oak is present, in the form of delicate toast and wood spice, but is balanced. So silky and delicious now, you can drink it, but the tannic balance suggests the cellar. Will evolve over the next 12 years, maybe longer..
