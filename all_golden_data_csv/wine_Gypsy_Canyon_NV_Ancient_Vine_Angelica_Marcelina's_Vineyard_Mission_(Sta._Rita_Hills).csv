country: US.
description: The multiple discoveries (the forgotten vines, the monks' secret recipe) behind Deborah Hall's project are fascinating enough, yet the golden orange wine is also utterly delicious. Old Fashioned cocktail-like aromas of maraschino cherry and orange rind mix with roasted nuts and a touch of brandy on the nose. Flavors of simmered honey, buttery whiskey and pear reduction entertain the palate, which benefits from remarkable acidity and grip, achieving utmost balance for a dessert wine..
