description: L'Ecole is one of the three partners in the Seven Hills vineyard, and sources its grapes from some of the oldest vines. The blend includes 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc, tight and spicy at first, then opening into a deeply flavored, brambly wine with a vivid mix of berry and stone. Firm tannins anchor it solidly and the overall structure suggests it could age for at least a decade, maybe two..
