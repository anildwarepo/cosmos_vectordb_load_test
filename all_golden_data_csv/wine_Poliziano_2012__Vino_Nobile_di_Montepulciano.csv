wine_Poliziano_2012__Vino_Nobile_di_Montepulciano,"Unnamed: 0: 67975.
country: Italy.
description: Aromas of ripe dark-skinned fruit, spice rack, grilled herb and a whiff of leather lead the nose of this blend of 85% Sangiovese, with 15% Colorino, Canaiolo and Merlot. The taut palate offers dried black cherry, espresso, aniseed and tobacco alongside bracing tannins that leave an astringent finish. Even though the tannins need to unwind, drink sooner rather than later to enjoy the remaining fruit richness..
