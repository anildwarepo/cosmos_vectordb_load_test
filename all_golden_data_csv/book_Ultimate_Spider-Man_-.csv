Description: This deluxe hardcover collects Ultimate Spider-Man Vol. 13: Hobgoblin and Ultimate Spider-Man Vol. 14: Warriors, plus extras. In Hobgoblin, it's the terrifying debut of the Ultimate Hobgoblin as Harry Osborn returns to Midtown High harboring a dark secret that will affect the lives of all those around him - especially his best friend, Peter Parker. And where does Harry's father - Norman Osborn, a.k.a. the Green Goblin - fit into all this? And in Warriors, the Gang War to end all Gang Wars begins! The Kingpin is in retreat, and that kind of a power vacuum won't last long. It's about to be filled by a figure of unabashed dread in the underworld: Hammerhead! Plus: the Ultimate debuts of several Marvel characters, including Moon Knight! And Spidey thinks he's had trouble before... but nothing has ever made him declare, ""Peter Parker no more!"" Collects Ultimate Spider-Man #72-85..
