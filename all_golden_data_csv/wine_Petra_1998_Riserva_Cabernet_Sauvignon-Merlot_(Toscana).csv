wine_Petra_1998_Riserva_Cabernet_Sauvignon-Merlot_(Toscana),"Unnamed: 0: 81394.
country: Italy.
description: Hailing from the town of Suvereto in the southern Maremma, this sophomore Cabernet-Merlot blend from the same owner as Bellavista and Contadi Castaldi in Franciacorta is flat-out awesome. One whiff of the bouquet says it all: earth, currant, blackberry and coffee. The palate is equally sensationalâ€”a magic carpet ride of plum fruit, pure oak and solid but forgiving tannins. Drink and enjoy any time through 2006..
