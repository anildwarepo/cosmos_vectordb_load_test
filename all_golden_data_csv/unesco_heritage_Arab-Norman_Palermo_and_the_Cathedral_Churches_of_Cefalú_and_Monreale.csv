unesco_heritage_Arab-Norman_Palermo_and_the_Cathedral_Churches_of_Cefalú_and_Monreale,"Name: Arab-Norman Palermo and the Cathedral Churches of Cefalú and Monreale.
short_description: <p>Located on the northern coast of Sicily, Arab-Norman Palermo includes a series of nine civil and religious structures dating from the era of the Norman kingdom of Sicily (1130-1194): two palaces, three churches, a cathedral, a bridge, as well as the cathedrals of Cefalú and Monreale. Collectively, they are an example of a social-cultural syncretism between Western, Islamic and Byzantine cultures on the island which gave rise to new concepts of space, structure and decoration. They also bear testimony to the fruitful coexistence of people of different origins and religions (Muslim, Byzantine, Latin, Jewish, Lombard and French).</p>.
