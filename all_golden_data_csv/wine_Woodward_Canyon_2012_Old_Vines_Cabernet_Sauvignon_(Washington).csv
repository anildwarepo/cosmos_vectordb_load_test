country: US.
description: A blend of Champoux (62%), Sagemoor (26%) and Woodward Canyon (12%) estate vineyards, this wine is aromatically brooding at present, with notes of coffee, toffee and vanilla bean alongside high-toned cherries, dried herbs and flowers. The palate is supremely rich, dense and layered, with milk chocolate, coffee and cherry flavors. Tannins are expertly managed and the wine brings plenty of textural appeal, combining richness and elegance. The barrel notes are primary now, so give them time to integrate. Best from 2025 to 2035..
