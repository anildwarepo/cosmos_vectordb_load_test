wine_Monteverro_2011_Tinata_Red_(Toscana),"Unnamed: 0: 122060.
country: Italy.
description: A blend of 70% Syrah and 30% Grenache, this robust red opens with aromas of ripe, black-skinned fruit, cedar and ground pepper. The concentrated palate doles out fleshy black cherries and black currants accented by licorice and allspice. Velvety tannins and the heat of evident alcohol provide the framework. It will definitely appeal to fans of bold, muscular wines, but it's shy on freshness so drink now..
