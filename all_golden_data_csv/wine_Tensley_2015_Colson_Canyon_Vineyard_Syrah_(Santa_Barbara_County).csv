description: This bottling is still very young and will vastly improve with time, but already shows many of the components that make this remote mountain-surrounded vineyard one of the more exciting slices of the region. Aromas of black currant and purple flowers are deep and heady, while the palate's richer blackberry-syrup notes are cut by a black-plum tang, fresh underbrush herbaceousness and tons of cola spice..
