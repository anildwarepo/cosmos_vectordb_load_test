country: France.
description: The full tilt of ripe peach hits the nose at once, followed by glimpses of marmalade and peach compote. The palate follows with the same aromatic intensity, enriching the peach compote notes even further with lemony barley sugar and fresh caramel, pierced by tangy citrus acidity. The flavors are mature and precise, opulent but tempered, and have a decadent touch. This is lovely now but has the concentration and drive to evolve. Drink now through 2030..
