country: US.
description: Hailing from a warm vintage, this vineyard-designated wine from northern Michigan shows a vibrant and integrated nose of ripe cherry and raspberry, with hints of white pepper, dusty cedar and button mushroom. Don't let the light color fool you; this wine shows an intriguing depth of flavor and breadth to the palate. Juicy red cherry tones are sprinkled with tilled earth and red flowers, all supported by finely-grained tannins..
