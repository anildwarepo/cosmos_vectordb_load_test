country: US.
description: The winery's Vintage Select Cabernet was famous in its day as one of California's greatest and most long-lived. It's not entirely clear why they changed the name to Vintage Selection, but this is still a very good wine. Ripe, succulent currant fruit and a soft mouthfeel are the highlights, seconded by complexity, dryness and a gentle application of new French oak. So gently appealing now, it's drinkable, and should develop for 6â€“10 years..
