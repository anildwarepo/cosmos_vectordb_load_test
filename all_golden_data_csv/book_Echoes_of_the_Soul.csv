Description: One Palm Sunday, Echo Bodine prayed to be granted a better understanding of worlds beyond this one, and three days later she found herself on an amazing voyage. Leaving her body behind, she traveled through life, death, and then beyond in a breath-taking vision of what awaits us all after this life. Echoes of the Soul is heartwarming and enlightening. In simple prose, Echo Bodine gently leads readers through realms of existence we all have yet to experience. Her inspiring images leave us with a hopeful vision of life after death — or, as Echo calls it, graduation, when we go to our real home. This inspiring and positive vision of the afterlife leaves the reader filled with hope, and even awe. Endorsements ""Echo is the clearest psychic I've ever read. Her vision of our souls and the journey they take is awesome and wonderful — and fills all who read it with an understanding that brings a deep sense of peace, a serenity at the core of our being. Echo's vision puts our lives into a vast perspective — the soul's perspective — infinitely broader than our usual perspective."" — Marc Allen, author of A Visionary Life.
