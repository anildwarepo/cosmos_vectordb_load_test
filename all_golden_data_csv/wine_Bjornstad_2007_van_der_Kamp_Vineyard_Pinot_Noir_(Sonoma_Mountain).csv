country: US.
description: It's hard to consistently get scores this high year after year, but Greg Bjornstad does, because he understands Pinot Noir. Specifically, he knows how to combine power, which is easy, with finesse, which isn't. This 2007, from an esteemed vineyard, is spectacular in wild forest cherry, cola, licorice, pine cone, anise, exotic spice and sandalwood flavors, even as it's perfectly balanced with crisp acidity, fine tannins and just-right oak. Lovely and complex. Nowâ€“2014..
