country: US.
description: This is Washington Syrah at its most distinctive. The fruit stands out with tart and tangy flavors of boysenberry, raspberry and a tartness reminiscent of cranberry. There are streaks of meat, smoke and bacon, and the acids are clean. This is a glorious food wine, but so juicy, assertive and delicious that it almost demands to be drunk on its own. Will it evolve in the cellar? Probably, but it's hard to keep your hands off it long enough to find out..
