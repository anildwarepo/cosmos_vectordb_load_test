country: South Africa.
description: A powerful, brooding nose of tobacco, smoke and red cherry starts this elegant Cabernet from Kanonkop. On the palate, more warming spices and tobacco, with smooth, ripe tannins that are fine and velvety. Some oak offers spice, but the wine is extremely balanced and food friendly. The lingering finish delivers a spin of red berry and smoke. Excellent now but could age a few years to further develop..
