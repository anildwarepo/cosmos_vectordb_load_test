Description: Written by Warren Ellis; Art by Darick Robertson and Rodney Ramos; Cover by Robertson The forces of darkness are closing in on outlaw journalist Spider Jerusalem and his merry, filthy band - but now they've got their own rope around the neck of corrupt President Callahan, and it's time to start tightening the noose. TRANSMETROPOLITAN: THE CURE, the ninth volume of the complete collection of the acclaimed series written by Warren Ellis (ORBITER, GLOBAL FREQUENCY) with art by Darick Robertson (Wolverine) and Rodney Ramos (GREEN LANTERN), reprints TRANSMETROPOLITAN #49-54 and features a striking new cover by Robertson. Jerusalem and his cohorts step up their investigation into Callahan's misdeeds and turn up some startling evidence... not to mention a sole surviving witness to the President's depravity. The problem, as always, will be getting the word out before the massive forces of the Executive Branch black out everything - and everyone - involved..
