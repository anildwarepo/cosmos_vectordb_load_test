description: Subtle notes of candied apricot mingle with barley sugar and light caramel in this splendid Eiswein. The palate reveals more intrigue, with pure lemon zest and aromatic inflections of crushed citrus foliage. While there is ample sweetness, this is cut by razor-sharp freshness and held in perfect poise. With time, ever more flavors join in: baked apple, candied orange peel and passion fruit. In its character, this would suit desserts that major on tropical, exotic fruit..
