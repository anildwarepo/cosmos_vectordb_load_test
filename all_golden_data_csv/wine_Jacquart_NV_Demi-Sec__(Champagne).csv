wine_Jacquart_NV_Demi-Sec__(Champagne),"Unnamed: 0: 73884.
country: France.
description: Rich and toasty, with tiny bubbles. The bouquet is laced with honey and vanilla scents. The palate suggests nuts and toast, without any noteworthy sweetness despite the demi-sec label. There’s good concentration and a ripe, toasty, slightly oxidized, nutty finish. This would work perfectly with the usual Champagne food suspects: foie gras, triple-cream cheeses and pâté, though it’s probably not the best choice for oysters..
