country: South Africa.
description: This beautiful Semillon-dominant blend that shows great finesse, depth and power. Rich and opulent in every way, notes of baked red apple, lemon verbena, honey-drizzled peach and sweet orange oil flood the nose and mouth, while additional flavors of hazelnut cream, fig bread and soft sweet spice carry into the long finish. Round, but with enough acidic lift to keep it from being flabby. Drink nowâ€“2015..
