country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: David Trafford. A blend of 62% Syrah and 33% Mourvèdre, this is plush and floral, with upfront aromas of violet and iris that grace the black cherry and plum fruits on the nose. Additional hints of black pepper, licorice, dried herbs and mocha lend depth to the palate, while medium tannins lend ample structure but not too much grip through the close. Balanced and approachable, drink now–2021..
