country: US.
description: They call it east, because the grapes are from the Vaca Mountains, and the vineyard faces west. It's a splendid wine, classically proportioned, with rich, thick tannins that have true Napa refinement. The flavors are also classic, suggesting cassis and cedar, with a distinct smack of indescribable minerals. There's a lot of smoky new oak, but it's proportionate to the wine's power. This serious new Napa Cab is great now, and should develop for many years..
