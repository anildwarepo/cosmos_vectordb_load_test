wine_Anthony_Nappa_2013_The_Savage_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(North_Fork_of_Long_Island),"Unnamed: 0: 22292.
country: US.
description: Long Island is not typically known for Cabernet Sauvignon, but in the hands of winemaker Anthony Nappa (who also crafts excellent Cabs at Raphael), the variety shows remarkable promise. Juxtaposing heady notes of bramble and dried herb against a backdrop of luscious black currant and plum, this wild-fermented red is enticingly “savage” in style. Sharp cranberry notes and mineral tones lend edge to a lingering finish..
