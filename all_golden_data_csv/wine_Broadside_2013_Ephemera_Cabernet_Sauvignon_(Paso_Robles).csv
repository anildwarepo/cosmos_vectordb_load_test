country: US.
description: Brian and Stephy Terrizzi have added this luxury-level bottling to their more affordably focused brand of wines, and it's an impressive addition. A deep and dense nose unleashes blackberries, licorice, crushed volcanic rocks, sexy dark chocolate, violet and black spice. Flavors of olallieberry and creamy dark and milk chocolate erupt on the palate, held together by soft tannins and energetic acidity. Drink 2017â€“2033..
