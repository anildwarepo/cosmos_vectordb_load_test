country: US.
description: This is the first all-estate-grown Chardonnay bottled by Woodward Canyon since 2003. Fermented in one-year-old Burgundy barrels, it's a Washington Chablis that brings exceptional focus and persistence to bear on flavors of intense citrus, honeyed candy, orange peel, spice and even a slim hint of chocolate. The mix of fruit, herb and mineral combines to create a terroir-laden wine that is beautifully complex and proportioned..
