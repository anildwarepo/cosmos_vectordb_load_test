country: France.
description: Stone, earth and hay are about to merge into notions of lanolin and chamomile: clearly this is a maturing wine at an early point of its evolution. The palate is fluid and has the texture of drenched chalky, stone. The fruit is hiding in the wings, only to appear as orange oil here or as apple scent there. The dryness shows every nuance of this earthy, wine from a historic, co-planed vineyard of Riesling, Pinot Gris and Gewurztraminer. What a triumph. Drink 2016–2026..
