title: Under the Willow Tree.
text: The region round the little town of Kjöge is very bleak and bare. Thetown certainly lies by the sea shore, which is always beautiful, butjust there it might be more beautiful than it is: all around are flatfields, and it is a long way to the forest. But when one is very muchat home in a place, one always finds something beautiful, andsomething that one longs for in the most charming spot in the worldthat is strange to us. We confess that, by the utmost boundary of thelittle town, where some humble gardens skirt the streamlet that fallsinto the sea, it must be very pretty in summer; and this was theopinion of the two children from neighbouring houses, who were playingthere, and forcing their way through the gooseberry bushes, to get toone another. In one of the gardens stood an elder tree, and in theother an old willow, and under the latter the children were especiallyvery fond of playing; they were allowed to play there, though, indeed,the tree stood close beside the stream, and they might easily havefallen into the water. But the eye of God watches over the littleones; if it did not, they would be badly off. And, moreover, they werevery careful with respect to the water; in fact, the boy was so muchafraid of it, that they could not lure him into the sea in summer,when the other children were splashing about in the waves.Accordingly, he was famously jeered and mocked at, and had to bearthe jeering and mockery as best he could. But once Joanna, theneighbour’s little girl, dreamed she was sailing in a boat, and Knudwaded out to join her till the water rose, first to his neck, andafterwards closed over his head, so that he disappeared altogether.From the time when little Knud heard of this dream, he would no longerbear the teasing of the other boys. He might go into the water now, hesaid, for Joanna had dreamed it. He certainly never carried the ideainto practice, but the dream was his great guide for all that.Their parents, who were poor people, often took tea together, and Knudand Joanna played in the gardens and on the high-road, where a row ofwillows had been planted beside the skirting ditch; these trees, withtheir polled tops, certainly did not look beautiful, but they were notput there for ornament, but for use. The old willow tree in the gardenwas much handsomer, and therefore the children were fond of sittingunder it. In the town itself there was a great market-place, and atthe time of the fair this place was covered with whole streets oftents and booths, containing silk ribbons, boots, and everything thata person could wish for. There was great crowding, and generally theweather was rainy; but it did not destroy the fragrance of thehoney-cakes and the gingerbread, of which there was a booth quitefull; and the best of it was, that the man who kept this booth cameevery year to lodge during the fair-time in the dwelling of littleKnud’s father. Consequently there came a present of a bit ofgingerbread every now and then, and of course Joanna received hershare of the gift. But, perhaps the most charming thing of all wasthat the gingerbread dealer knew all sorts of tales, and could evenrelate histories about his own gingerbread cakes; and one evening, inparticular, he told a story about them which made such a deepimpression on the children that they never forgot it; and for thatreason it is perhaps advisable that we should hear it too, moreespecially as the story is not long.“On the shop-board,” he said, “lay two gingerbread cakes, one in theshape of a man with a hat, the other of a maiden without a bonnet;both their faces were on the side that was uppermost, for they were tobe looked at on that side, and not on the other; and, indeed, mostpeople have a favourable side from which they should be viewed. On theleft side the man wore a bitter almond–that was his heart; but themaiden, on the other hand, was honey-cake all over. They were placedas samples on the shop-board, and remaining there a long time, at lastthey fell in love with one another, but neither told the other, asthey should have done if they had expected anything to come of it.“‘He is a man, and therefore he must speak first,’ she thought; butshe felt quite contented, for she knew her love was returned.“His thoughts were far more extravagant, as is always the case with aman. He dreamed that he was a real street boy, that he had fourpennies of his own, and that he purchased the maiden, and ate her up.So they lay on the shop-board for weeks and weeks, and grew dry andhard, but the thoughts of the maiden became ever more gentle andmaidenly.“‘It is enough for me that I have lived on the same table with him,’she said, and crack! she broke in two.“‘If she had only known of my love, she would have kept together alittle longer,’ he thought.“And that is the story, and here they are, both of them,” said thebaker in conclusion. “They are remarkable for their curious history,and for their silent love, which never came to anything. And therethey are for you!” and, so saying, he gave Joanna the man who was yetentire, and Knud got the broken maiden; but the children had been somuch impressed by the story that they could not summon courage to eatthe lovers up.On the following day they went out with them to the churchyard, andsat down by the church wall, which is covered, winter and summer, withthe most luxuriant ivy as with a rich carpet. Here they stood the twocake figures up in the sunshine among the green leaves, and told thestory to a group of other children; they told them of the silent lovewhich led to nothing. It was called _love_ because the story was solovely, on that they all agreed. But when they turned to look again atthe gingerbread pair, a big boy, out of mischief, had eaten up thebroken maiden. The children cried about this, and afterwards–probablythat the poor lover might not be left in the world lonely anddesolate–they ate him up too; but they never forgot the story.The children were always together by the elder tree and under thewillow, and the little girl sang the most beautiful songs with a voicethat was clear as a bell. Knud, on the other hand, had not a note ofmusic in him, but he knew the words of the songs, and that, at least,was something. The people of Kjöge, even to the rich wife of thefancy-shop keeper, stood still and listened when Joanna sang. “She hasa very sweet voice, that little girl,” they said.Those were glorious days, but they could not last for ever. Theneighbours were neighbours no longer. The little maiden’s mother wasdead, and the father intended to marry again, in the capital, where hehad been promised a living as a messenger, which was to be a verylucrative office. And the neighbours separated regretfully, thechildren weeping heartily, but the parents promised that they shouldat least write to one another once a year.And Knud was bound apprentice to a shoemaker, for the big boy couldnot be allowed to run wild any longer; and moreover he was confirmed.Ah, how gladly on that day of celebration would he have been inCopenhagen with little Joanna! but he remained in Kjöge, and had neveryet been to Copenhagen, though the little town is only five Danishmiles distant from the capital; but far across the bay, when the skywas clear, Knud had seen the towers in the distance, and on the day ofhis confirmation he could distinctly see the golden cross on theprincipal church glittering in the sun.Ah, how often his thoughts were with Joanna! Did she think of him?Yes. Towards Christmas there came a letter from her father to theparents of Knud, to say that they were getting on very well inCopenhagen, and especially might Joanna look forward to a brilliantfuture on the strength of her fine voice. She had been engaged in thetheatre in which people sing, and was already earning some money, outof which she sent her dear neighbours of Kjöge a dollar for the merryChristmas Eve. They were to drink her health, she had herself added ina postscript, and in the same postscript there stood further, “A kindgreeting to Knud.”The whole family wept: and yet all this was very pleasant; those werejoyful tears that they shed. Knud’s thoughts had been occupied everyday with Joanna; and now he knew that she also thought of him: and thenearer the time came when his apprenticeship would be over, the moreclearly did it appear to him that he was very fond of Joanna, and thatshe must be his wife; and when he thought of this, a smile came uponhis lips, and he drew the thread twice as fast as before, and pressedhis foot hard against the knee-strap. He ran the awl far into hisfinger, but he did not care for that. He determined not to play thedumb lover, as the two gingerbread cakes had done: the story shouldteach him a lesson.And now he was a journeyman, and his knapsack was packed ready for hisjourney: at length, for the first time in his life, he was to go toCopenhagen, where a master was already waiting for him. How gladJoanna would be! She was now seventeen years old, and he nineteen.Already in Kjöge he had wanted to buy a gold ring for her; but herecollected that such things were to be had far better in Copenhagen.And now he took leave of his parents, and on a rainy day, late in theautumn, went forth on foot out of the town of his birth. The leaveswere falling down from the trees, and he arrived at his new master’sin the metropolis wet to the skin. Next Sunday he was to pay a visitto Joanna’s father. The new journeyman’s clothes were brought forth,and the new hat from Kjöge was put on, which became Knud very well,for till this time he had only worn a cap. And he found the house hesought, and mounted flight after flight of stairs until he becamealmost giddy. It was terrible to him to see how people lived piled upone over the other in the dreadful city.Everything in the room had a prosperous look, and Joanna’s fatherreceived him very kindly. To the new wife he was a stranger, but sheshook hands with him, and gave him some coffee.“Joanna will be glad to see you,” said the father: “you have grownquite a nice young man. You shall see her presently. She is a girl whorejoices my heart, and, please God, she will rejoice it yet more. Shehas her own room now, and pays us rent for it.” And the father knockedquite politely at the door, as if he were a visitor, and then theywent in.But how pretty everything was in that room! such an apartment wascertainly not to be found in all Kjöge: the queen herself could not bemore charmingly lodged. There were carpets, there were window curtainsquite down to the floor, and around were flowers and pictures, and amirror into which there was almost danger that a visitor might step,for it was as large as a door; and there was even a velvet chair.Knud saw all this at a glance: and yet he saw nothing but Joanna. Shewas a grown maiden, quite different from what Knud had fancied her,and much more beautiful. In all Kjöge there was not a girl like her.How graceful she was, and with what an odd unfamiliar glance shelooked at Knud! But that was only for a moment, and then she rushedtowards him as if she would have kissed him. She did not really do so,but she came very near it. Yes, she was certainly rejoiced at thearrival of the friend of her youth! The tears were actually in hereyes; and she had much to say, and many questions to put concerningall, from Knud’s parents down to the elder tree and the willow, whichshe called Elder-mother and Willow-father, as if they had been humanbeings; and indeed they might pass as such, just as well as thegingerbread cakes; and of these she spoke too, and of their silentlove, and how they had lain upon the shop-board and split in two–andthen she laughed very heartily; but the blood mounted into Knud’scheeks, and his heart beat thick and fast. No, she had not grown proud at all. And it was through her–he noticed it well–that her parents invited him to stay the whole evening with them; and she poured out the tea and gave him a cup with her own hands; and afterwards she took a book and read aloud to them, and it seemed to Knud that what sheread was all about himself and his love, for it matched so well withhis thoughts; and then she sang a simple song, but through her singingit became like a history, and seemed to be the outpouring of her veryheart. Yes, certainly she was fond of Knud. The tears coursed down hischeeks–he could not restrain them, nor could he speak a single word:he seemed to himself as if he were struck dumb; and yet she pressedhis hand, and said,“You have a good heart, Knud–remain always as you are now.”That was an evening of matchless delight to Knud; to sleep after itwas impossible, and accordingly Knud did not sleep.At parting, Joanna’s father had said, “Now, you won’t forget usaltogether! Don’t let the whole winter go by without once coming tosee us again;” and therefore he could very well go again the nextSunday, and resolved to do so. But every evening when working hourswere over–and they worked by candlelight there–Knud went out throughthe town: he went into the street in which Joanna lived, and looked upat her window; it was almost always lit up, and one evening he couldsee the shadow of her face quite plainly on the curtain–and that wasa grand evening for him. His master’s wife did not like hisgallivanting abroad every evening, as she expressed it; and she shookher head; but the master only smiled.“He is only a young fellow,” he said.But Knud thought to himself: “On Sunday I shall see her, and I shalltell her how completely she reigns in my heart and soul, and that shemust be my little wife. I know I am only a poor journeyman shoemaker,but I shall work and strive–yes, I shall tell her so. Nothing comesof silent love: I have learned that from the cakes.”And Sunday came round, and Knud sallied forth; but, unluckily, theywere all invited out for that evening, and were obliged to tell himso. Joanna pressed his hand and said,“Have you ever been to the theatre? You must go once. I shall sing onWednesday, and if you have time on that evening, I will send you aticket; my father knows where your master lives.”How kind that was of her! And on Wednesday at noon he received asealed paper, with no words written in it; but the ticket was there,and in the evening Knud went to the theatre for the first time in hislife. And what did he see? He saw Joanna, and how charming and howbeautiful she looked! She was certainly married to a stranger, butthat was all in the play–something that was only make-believe, asKnud knew very well. If it had been real, he thought, she would neverhave had the heart to send him a ticket that he might go and see it.And all the people shouted and applauded, and Knud cried out “hurrah!”Even the king smiled at Joanna, and seemed to delight in her. Ah, howsmall Knud felt! but then he loved her so dearly, and thought thatshe loved him too; but it was for the man to speak the first word, asthe gingerbread maiden in the child’s story had taught him: and therewas a great deal for him in that story.So soon as Sunday came, he went again. He felt as if he were goinginto a church. Joanna was alone, and received him–it could not havehappened more fortunately. “It is well that you are come,” she said.“I had an idea of sending my father to you, only I felt a presentimentthat you would be here this evening; for I must tell you that I startfor France on Friday: I must go there, if I am to become efficient.”It seemed to Knud as if the whole room were whirling round and roundwith him. He felt as if his heart would presently burst: no tear roseto his eyes, but still it was easy to see how sorrowful he was.“You honest, faithful soul!” she exclaimed; and these words of hersloosened Knud’s tongue. He told her how constantly he loved her, andthat she must become his wife; and as he said this, he saw Joannachange colour and turn pale. She let his hand fall, and answered,seriously and mournfully,“Knud, do not make yourself and me unhappy. I shall always be a goodsister to you, one in whom you may trust, but I shall never beanything more.” And she drew her white hand over his hot forehead.“Heaven gives us strength for much,” she said, “if we only endeavourto do our best.”At that moment the stepmother came into the room; and Joanna saidquickly,“Knud is quite inconsolable because I am going away. Come, be a man,”she continued, and laid her hand upon his shoulder; and it seemed asif they had been talking of the journey, and nothing else. “You are achild,” she added; “but now you must be good and reasonable, as youused to be under the willow tree, when we were both children.”But Knud felt as if the whole world had slid out of its course, andhis thoughts were like a loose thread fluttering to and fro in thewind. He stayed, though he could not remember if she had asked him tostay; and she was kind and good, and poured out his tea for him, andsang to him. It had not the old tone, and yet it was wonderfullybeautiful, and made his heart feel ready to burst. And then theyparted. Knud did not offer her his hand, but she seized it, and said,“Surely you will shake hands with your sister at parting, oldplayfellow!”And she smiled through the tears that were rolling over her cheeks,and she repeated the word “brother”–and certainly there was goodconsolation in that–and thus they parted.She sailed to France, and Knud wandered about the muddy streets ofCopenhagen. The other journeymen in the workshop asked him why he wentabout so gloomily, and told him he should go and amuse himself withthem, for he was a young fellow.And they went with him to the dancing-rooms. He saw many handsomegirls there, but certainly not one like Joanna; and here, where hethought to forget her, she stood more vividly than ever before theeyes of his soul. “Heaven gives us strength for a great deal, if weonly try to do our best,” she had said; and holy thoughts came intohis mind, and he folded his hands. The violins played, and the girlsdanced round in a circle; and he was quite startled, for it seemed tohim as if he were in a place to which he ought not to have broughtJoanna–for she was there with him, in his heart; and accordingly hewent out. He ran through the streets, and passed by the house whereshe had dwelt: it was dark there, dark everywhere, and empty, andlonely. The world went on its course, but Knud pursued his lonely way,unheedingly.The winter came, and the streams were frozen. Everything seemed to bepreparing for a burial. But when spring returned, and the firststeamer was to start, a longing seized him to go away, far, far intothe world, but not to France. So he packed his knapsack, and wanderedfar into the German land, from city to city, without rest or peace;and it was not till he came to the glorious old city of Nuremberg thathe could master his restless spirit; and in Nuremberg, therefore, hedecided to remain.Nuremberg is a wonderful old city, and looks as if it were cut out ofan old picture-book. The streets seem to stretch themselves along justas they please. The houses do not like standing in regular ranks.Gables with little towers, arabesques, and pillars, start out over thepathway, and from the strange peaked roofs water-spouts, formed likedragons or great slim dogs, extend far over the street.Here in the market-place stood Knud, with his knapsack on his back. Hestood by one of the old fountains that are adorned with splendidbronze figures, scriptural and historical, rising up between thegushing jets of water. A pretty servant-maid was just filling herpails, and she gave Knud a refreshing draught; and as her hand wasfull of roses, she gave him one of the flowers, and he accepted it asa good omen.From the neighbouring church the strains of the organ were sounding:they seemed to him as familiar as the tones of the organ at home atKjöge; and he went into the great cathedral. The sunlight streamed inthrough the stained glass windows, between the two lofty slenderpillars. His spirit became prayerful, and peace returned to his soul.And he sought and found a good master in Nuremberg, with whom hestayed, and in whose house he learned the German language.The old moat round the town has been converted into a number of littlekitchen gardens; but the high walls are standing yet, with their heavytowers. The ropemaker twists his ropes on a gallery or walk built ofwood, inside the town wall, where elder bushes grow out of the cleftsand cracks, spreading their green twigs over the little low housesthat stand below; and in one of these dwelt the master with whom Knudworked; and over the little garret window at which Knud sat the elderwaved its branches.Here he lived through a summer and a winter; but when the spring cameagain he could bear it no longer. The elder was in blossom, and itsfragrance reminded him so of home, that he fancied himself back in thegarden at Kjöge; and therefore Knud went away from his master, anddwelt with another, farther in the town, over whose house no elderbush grew.His workshop was quite close to one of the old stone bridges, by a lowwater-mill, that rushed and foamed always. Without, rolled the roaringstream, hemmed in by houses, whose old decayed gables looked ready totopple down into the water. No elder grew here–there was not even aflower-pot with its little green plant; but just opposite the workshopstood a great old willow tree, that seemed to cling fast to the house,for fear of being carried away by the water, and which stretched forthits branches over the river, just as the willow at Kjöge spread itsarms across the streamlet by the gardens there.Yes, he had certainly gone from the “Elder-mother” to the“Willow-father.” The tree here had something, especially on moonlightevenings, that went straight to his heart–and that something was notin the moonlight, but in the old tree itself.Nevertheless, he could not remain. Why not? Ask the willow tree, askthe blooming elder! And therefore he bade farewell to his master inNuremberg, and journeyed onward.To no one did he speak of Joanna–in his secret heart he hid hissorrow; and he thought of the deep meaning in the old childish storyof the two cakes. Now he understood why the man had a bitter almond inhis breast–he himself felt the bitterness of it; and Joanna, who wasalways so gentle and kind, was typified by the honey-cake. The strapof his knapsack seemed so tight across his chest that he couldscarcely breathe; he loosened it, but was not relieved. He saw buthalf the world around him; the other half he carried about him, andwithin himself. And thus it stood with him.Not till he came in sight of the high mountains did the world appearfreer to him; and now his thoughts were turned without, and tears cameinto his eyes.The Alps appeared to him as the folded wings of the earth; how if theywere to unfold themselves, and display their variegated pictures ofblack woods, foaming waters, clouds, and masses of snow? At the lastday, he thought, the world will lift up its great wings, and mountupwards towards the sky, and burst like a soap-bubble in the glance ofthe Highest!“Ah,” sighed he, “that the Last Day were come!”Silently he wandered through the land, that seemed to him as anorchard covered with soft turf. From the wooden balconies of thehouses the girls who sat busy with their lace-making nodded at him;the summits of the mountains glowed in the red sun of the evening;and when he saw the green lakes gleaming among the dark trees, hethought of the coast by the Bay of Kjöge, and there was a longing inhis bosom, but it was pain no more.There where the Rhine rolls onward like a great billow, and bursts,and is changed into snow-white, gleaming, cloud-like masses, as ifclouds were being created there, with the rainbow fluttering like aloose band above them; there he thought of the water-mill at Kjöge,with its rushing, foaming water.Gladly would he have remained in the quiet Rhenish town, but here toowere too many elder trees and willows, and therefore he journeyed on,over the high, mighty mountains, through shattered walls of rock, andon roads that clung like swallows’ nests to the mountain-side. Thewaters foamed on in the depths, the clouds were below him, and hestrode on over thistles, Alpine roses, and snow, in the warm summersun; and saying farewell to the lands of the North, he passed on underthe shade of blooming chestnut trees, and through vineyards and fieldsof maize. The mountains were a wall between him and all hisrecollections; and he wished it to be so.Before him lay a great glorious city which they called _Milano_, andhere he found a German master who gave him work. They were an oldpious couple, in whose workshop he now laboured. And the two oldpeople became quite fond of the quiet journeyman, who said little, butworked all the more, and led a pious Christian life. To himself alsoit seemed as if Heaven had lifted the heavy burden from his heart.His favourite pastime was to mount now and then upon the mighty marblechurch, which seemed to him to have been formed of the snow of hisnative land, fashioned into roofs, and pinnacles, and decorated openhalls: from every corner and every point the white statues smiled uponhim. Above him was the blue sky, below him the city and thewide-spreading Lombard plains, and towards the north the highmountains clad with perpetual snow; and he thought of the church atKjöge, with its red, ivy-covered walls, but he did not long to gothither: here, beyond the mountains, he would be buried.He had dwelt here a year, and three years had passed away since heleft his home, when one day his master took him into the city, not tothe circus where riders exhibited, but to the opera, where was a hallworth seeing. There were seven storeys, from each of which beautifulsilken curtains hung down, and from the ground to the dizzy height ofthe roof sat elegant ladies, with bouquets of flowers in their hands,as if they were at a ball, and the gentlemen were in full dress, andmany of them decorated with gold and silver. It was as bright there asin the brilliant sunshine, and the music rolled gloriously throughthe building. Everything was much more splendid than in the theatre atCopenhagen, but then Joanna had been there, and—-could it be? Yes,it was like magic–she was here also! for the curtain rose, and Joannaappeared, dressed in silk and gold, with a crown upon her head: shesang as he thought none but angels could sing, and came far forward,quite to the front of the stage, and smiled as only Joanna couldsmile, and looked straight down at Knud. Poor Knud seized his master’shand, and called out aloud, “Joanna!” but no one heard but the master,who nodded his head, for the loud music sounded above everything.“Yes, yes, her name is Joanna,” said the master; and he drew forth aprinted playbill, and showed Knud her name–for the full name wasprinted there.No, it was not a dream! All the people applauded, and threw wreathsand flowers to her, and every time she went away they called her back,so that she was always going and coming.In the street the people crowded round her carriage, and drew it awayin triumph. Knud was in the foremost row, and shouted as joyously asany; and when the carriage stopped before her brilliantly lightedhouse, Knud stood close beside the door of the carriage. It flew open,and she stepped out: the light fell upon her dear face, as she smiled,and made a kindly gesture of thanks, and appeared deeply moved. Knudlooked straight into her face, and she looked into his, but she didnot know him. A man, with a star glittering on his breast, gave herhis arm–and it was whispered about that the two were engaged.Then Knud went home and packed his knapsack. He was determined to goback to his own home, to the elder and the willow tree–ah, under thewillow tree! A whole life is sometimes lived through in a single hour.The old couple begged him to remain, but no words could induce him tostay. It was in vain they told him that winter was coming, and pointedout that snow had already fallen in the mountains; he said he couldmarch on, with his knapsack on his back, in the wake of theslow-moving carriage, for which they would have to clear a path.So he went away towards the mountains, and marched up them and downthem. His strength was giving way, but still he saw no village, nohouse; he marched on towards the north. The stars gleamed above him,his feet stumbled, and his head grew dizzy. Deep in the valley starswere shining too, and it seemed as if there were another sky belowhim. He felt he was ill. The stars below him became more and morenumerous, and glowed brighter and brighter, and moved to and fro. Itwas a little town whose lights beamed there; and when he understoodthat, he exerted the remains of his strength, and at last reached theshelter of a humble inn.That night and the whole of the following day he remained there, forhis body required rest and refreshment. It was thawing; there was rainin the valley. But early on the second morning came a man with anorgan, who played a tune of home; and now Knud could stay no longer.He continued his journey towards the north, marching onward for manydays with haste and hurry, as if he were trying to get home before allwere dead there; but to no one did he speak of his longing, for no onewould have believed in the sorrow of his heart, the deepest a humanheart can feel. Such a grief is not for the world, for it is notamusing; nor is it even for friends; and moreover he had no friends–astranger, he wandered through strange lands towards his home in thenorth.It was evening. He was walking on the public high-road. The frostbegan to make itself felt, and the country soon became flatter,containing mere field and meadow. By the road-side grew a great willowtree. Everything reminded him of home, and he sat down under the tree:he felt very tired, his head began to nod, and his eyes closed inslumber, but still he was conscious that the tree stretched its armsabove him; and in his wandering fancy the tree itself appeared to bean old, mighty man–it seemed as if the “Willow-father” himself hadtaken up his tired son in his arms, and were carrying him back intothe land of home, to the bare bleak shore of Kjöge, to the garden ofhis childhood. Yes, he dreamed it was the willow tree of Kjöge thathad travelled out into the world to seek him, and that now had foundhim, and had led him back into the little garden by the streamlet, andthere stood Joanna, in all her splendour, with the golden crown on herhead, as he had seen her last, and she called out “welcome” to him.And before him stood two remarkable shapes, which looked much morehuman than he remembered them to have been in his childhood: they hadchanged also, but they were still the two cakes that turned the rightside towards him, and looked very well.“We thank you,” they said to Knud. “You have loosened our tongues, andhave taught us that thoughts should be spoken out freely, or nothingwill come of them; and now something has indeed come of it–we arebetrothed.”Then they went hand in hand through the streets of Kjöge, and theylooked very respectable in every way: there was no fault to find with_them_. And they went on, straight towards the church, and Knud andJoanna followed them; they also were walking hand in hand; and thechurch stood there as it had always stood, with its red walls, onwhich the green ivy grew; and the great door of the church flew open,and the organ sounded, and they walked up the long aisle of thechurch. “Our master first,” said the cake-couple, and made room forJoanna and Knud, who knelt by the altar, and she bent her head overhim, and tears fell from her eyes, but they were icy cold, for it wasthe ice around her heart that was melting–melting by his strong love;and the tears fell upon his burning cheeks, and he awoke, and wassitting under the old willow tree in the strange land, in the coldwintry evening: an icy hail was falling from the clouds and beating onhis face.“That was the most delicious hour of my life!” he said, “and it wasbut a dream. Oh, let me dream again!” And he closed his eyes oncemore, and slept and dreamed.Towards morning there was a great fall of snow. The wind drifted thesnow over him, but he slept on. The villagers came forth to go tochurch, and by the road-side sat a journeyman. He was dead–frozen todeath under the willow tree!.
