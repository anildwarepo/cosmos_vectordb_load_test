Description: The language young children use is the language they learn. In clear, practical terms, this primer explains how early childhood educators and primary teachers can support the efforts of non-English speaking children in nursery schools, day care centres and classrooms to use -- and learn -- English as a second language. Loaded with ideas and down-to-earth advice from two highly experienced and internationally renowned ESL experts, it's an essential guide to developing a sensitive, welcoming program for all of the world's children..
