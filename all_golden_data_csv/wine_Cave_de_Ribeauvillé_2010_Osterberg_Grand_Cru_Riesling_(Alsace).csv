country: France.
description: A hint of caramelized apple clings to the nose, as well as a certain creaminess. The palate reveals a core of stone, chalk and lanolin, all framed with the purest notion of lemon zest. This shows lovely flavors of maturity but has only just got going. The freshness is incisive, the complexity and length immense. This is simply beautiful and leaves you totally refreshed. Savor this slowly. Drink now through 2030..
