country: France.
description: The nose is a mere promise compared to the full-on experience that follows. The dry palate is a lovely synthesis of ripe, textured and tart elements: of russet-pear peel and flesh, of grapefruit zestiness and spice, of ripe and aromatic tangerine. This is concentrated and full of flavor, animated and full of impact. This seems like energizing fuel. Mouthwatering freshness creates a long fruit-rich driven finish..
