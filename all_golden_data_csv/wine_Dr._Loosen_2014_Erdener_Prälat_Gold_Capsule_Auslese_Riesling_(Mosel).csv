country: Germany.
description: Dulcet peach, apricot and citrus sweetness extends languorously from nose to finish in this powerfully ripe, hedonistic wine. It's dancing and delicate in frame, yet unctuously juicy, filling the mouth with a blanket of luminous fruit. Sprightly tangerine acidity and delicate tea-leaf tannins lend structure to a long, penetrating finish. It's irresistible already but should continue to drink well for decades..
