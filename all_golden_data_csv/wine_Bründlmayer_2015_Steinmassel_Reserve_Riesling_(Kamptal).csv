country: Austria.
description: Delicious notions of ripe greengages haunt the nose, alongside fragrant orange peel. The palate is still taut and tight, sprightly and streamlined, as if powered and propelled forward by invisible citrus force. There is such drive and precision here, you almost feel movement and speed. The finish is clean but clearly this is for the longer run. It will take bottle age for this to reveal its scented, fruit-laden core. Drink 2022–2040..
