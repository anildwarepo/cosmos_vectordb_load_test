country: US.
description: Here's a Cabernet producer to keep your eyes on. The winemaker is Kian Tavakoli, who earned his stripes at Opus One and Clos du Val. The wine is sourced from three top vineyards, including To Kalon. It's a very ambitious effort, one that defines great Napa Cab. Softly tannic now in its youth, the blackberry, currant and smoky oak flavors are delicious and complex, offering waves of ever-changing nuances. Should develop well for several years..
