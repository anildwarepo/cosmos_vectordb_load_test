country: England.
description: A fragrant, sherbety cloud of spring meadow and lemon hovers above the glass. Grassy freshness frames the bright, pure lemon notions that dominate nose and palate. This wine is utterly fresh, citric and brisk. The mouthfeel is taut and slender, with only the slightest edge of autolytic notes and a structure of freshness and purity. It almost has a cleansing quality on its superbright, clean finish..
