wine_André_Kientzler_2015_Geisberg_Grand_Cru_Riesling_(Alsace),"Unnamed: 0: 22373.
country: France.
description: The nose is slightly subdued with a faint touch of lemon balm and orange. The palate unpacks this with notes of both citrus and earth. There is something textured about that earthy feel, while all the freshness of lemon and orange zest dazzles the senses. This has purity and precision which lend a sense of weightlessness despite the undoubted power of the wine. The finish is wonderfully dry, refreshing and absolutely lip-smacking. Drink 2017–2030..
