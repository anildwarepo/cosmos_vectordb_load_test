wine_Gramercy_2011_Syrah_(Walla_Walla_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 20358.
country: US.
description: In 2011 the alcohol drops a bit and the fruit comes forward, stepping slightly away from the strongly herbal flavors of the 2010. It's reflective of the vintage, and perhaps more immediately approachable, without sacrificing any of the complexity or structure that typifies Gramercy wines. Strongly aromatic flavors of blackberry, black cherry, cola and licorice are all in play, backed with refreshing minerality. The wine should age beautifully for a decade or more..
