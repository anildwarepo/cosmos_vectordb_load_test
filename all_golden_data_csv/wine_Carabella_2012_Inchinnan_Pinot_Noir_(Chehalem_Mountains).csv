country: US.
description: Inchinnan, the winery explains, is a Scottish word that means some little special place. Special indeed is this fruit, a three-clone estate vineyard selection. Blackberry and black cherry dappled with cinnamon is at the heart of it, supported with balanced natural acidity. A bit darker in color and flavor than the estate bottling, it's immediately enjoyable and structured for medium-term cellaring..
