country: US.
description: The Eyrie reserve is a single vineyard selection from the estate's oldest vines, planted between 1967 and 1973. The longevity of these wines is a proven fact; they evolve (and generally improve) for decades. This is already delicious, smoky, almost ethereal, with truly Burgundian finesse and depth. This wine, as much or more than any other, expresses the potential of Oregon Pinot Noir to approach the majesty of fine Burgundy..
