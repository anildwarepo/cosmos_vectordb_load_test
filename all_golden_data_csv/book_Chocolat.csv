Description: When an exotic stranger, Vianne Rocher, arrives in the French village of Lansquenet and opens a chocolaterie directly opposite the church, Father Reynaud identifies her as a danger to his flock - especially as it is the beginning of Lent. War is declared as the priest denounces the newcomer's wares as the ultimate sin. Suddenly Vianne's shop-cum-cafe means that there is somewhere for secrets and grievances. But Vianne's plans for an Easter Chocolate Festival divide the whole community into an escalating 'Church not Chocolate' battle..
