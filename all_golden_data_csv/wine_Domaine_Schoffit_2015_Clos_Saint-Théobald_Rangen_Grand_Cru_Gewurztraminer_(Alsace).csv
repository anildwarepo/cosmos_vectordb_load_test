description: Peach and honeysuckle already have a notion of honeyed sweetness and ripeness on the nose. The palate boosts both fruit and floral notion to the top, where honeysuckle and rose petal notes meeting with peach on the medium-sweet palate. This is full on, joyous, juicy and rich with expressive, exuberant flavor. An underlying concentration almost feeds this with a fiery dynamic force. The finish is medium sweet but comes with a wonderfully redeeming pure lemon streak. This is ready now but will get even better with age. Drink 2017–2037..
