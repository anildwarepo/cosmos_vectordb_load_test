Description: Children have been vanishing - there are no leads - just a kidnapper at large. The police have failed, the families are distraught and the morale at Lafferton station has collapsed. Then Detective Chief Inspector Simon Serailler receives a call: a child has been snatched in Yorkshire. Has the abductor struck again? And will they find this child alive? In The Risk of Darkness Simon Serailler takes on killing and kidnap, evil and innocence. The result is a compulsively readable and often chilling novel. 'Not all great novelists can write crime fiction but when one like Susan Hill does the result is stunning' Ruth Rendell.
