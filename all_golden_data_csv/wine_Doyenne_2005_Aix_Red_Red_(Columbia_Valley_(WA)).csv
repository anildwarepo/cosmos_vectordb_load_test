wine_Doyenne_2005_Aix_Red_Red_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 124958.
country: US.
description: The 2005 Doyenne Aix is 50% Cabernet, 48% Syrah and 2% Mourvèdre. The increased percentage of Syrah and the extra dollop of Mourvèdre ramps this up to a stiffer, more substantial wine than the 2004. It's a Cabernet-driven complement to the DeLille D2, replete with muscle and nerve. Dark and chewy, the wine has picked up a little Rhône-like savage-ness from the Mourvèdre, especially in the aroma. The tannins are chewy and a bit leafy, and need some airing out, but there's plenty of meaty flavor here..
