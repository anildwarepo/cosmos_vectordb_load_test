country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Andries Burger. Always a stunner, the 2016 Wagon Trail delivers impeccable balance, freshness and minerality that can easily translate in the wine being mistaken for one from another iconic Old World Chardonnay region, and probably at about five times the price. It's decadently ripe and toasty, with present yet refined notes of baked apple, lemon meringue and toasted hazelnut that leave you begging for more. The rich mouthfeel is immediately countered by superb, bright acidity and stony minerality before veering back into notes of toasted brioche and spiced citrus peel on the endless finish. A true stunner that will age well through 2028..
