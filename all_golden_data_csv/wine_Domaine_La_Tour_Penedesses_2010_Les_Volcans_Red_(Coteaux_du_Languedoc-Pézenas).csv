country: France.
description: The youthful nose is primed with black currant, blueberry, earth and licorice. Generous and supple on the palate with restrained acidity, the tannins show some sinew, yet they are well-integrated. It's fullbodied, with slightly spirituous alcohol, however, the excellent concentration on the palate can support this. Overall, the wine is well knit, including its inflections of baked cobbler and vanilla bean from the oak aging. Drink now and for five more years..
