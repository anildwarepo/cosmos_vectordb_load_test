short_description: <p>Puebla, which was founded <em>ex nihilo</em> in 1531, is situated about 100 km east of Mexico City, at the foot of the Popocatepetl volcano. It has preserved its great religious structures such as the 16thâ€“17th-century cathedral and fine buildings like the old archbishop's palace, as well as a host of houses with walls covered in tiles (<em>azulejos</em>). The new aesthetic concepts resulting from the fusion of European and American styles were adopted locally and are peculiar to the Baroque district of Puebla.</p>.
