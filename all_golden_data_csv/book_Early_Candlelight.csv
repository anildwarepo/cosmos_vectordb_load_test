Description: ""Young Deedee DuGay knew everyone at Fort Snelling in the 1830s ... On an island in the Mississippi, near yet remote, lived Jasper Page, the leading fur trader in the territory ... And although he was far above her in social class, Deedee dared to love him. Their story is a rich and romantic re-creation of an important time in Minnesota history ... A new introduction compares the fictional Jasper Page to Henry H. Sibley, fur trader and first governor of Minnesota, upon whom the character was based""--Back cover..
