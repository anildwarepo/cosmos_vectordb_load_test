country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Danie Steytler. A blend of 45% Pinotage, 45% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot, this isn't a shy or reserved wine, though it expresses overall balance and harmony in all its elements. Intense aromas of pressed purple flowers, wild strawberry and juicy muddled cherries abound on the nose, with a cinnamon thread weaving throughout. Serious tannins frame the ripe, concentrated palate, with rich fruit flavors that are ripe without being overly so. The finish is long and evolving, carrying you from the fruit to leather and earth and finally toasted spice. Drink 2021â€“2027..
