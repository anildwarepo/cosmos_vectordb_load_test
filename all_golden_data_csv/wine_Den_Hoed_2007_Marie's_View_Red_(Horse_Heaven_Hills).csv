country: US.
description: It's a difficult challenge to blend six different grapes into a wine without sacrificing focus, but winemaker Rob Newsom has done a splendid job with this new vintage of Marie's View. Roughly a third Cabernet and a third Syrah, which provide a potent core of deep red and black fruits, the wine is nuanced with layers of spice, leaf, toasted grain, loam and coffee grounds. Fine acids promise a long life..
