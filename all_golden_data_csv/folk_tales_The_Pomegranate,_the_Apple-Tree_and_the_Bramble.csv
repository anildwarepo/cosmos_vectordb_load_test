title: The Pomegranate, the Apple-Tree and the Bramble.
text: A Pomegranate and an Apple-tree were disputing about the quality of their fruits, and each claimed that its own was the better of the two. High words passed between them, and a violent quarrel was imminent, when a Bramble impudently poked its head out of a neighbouring hedge and said, “There, that’s enough, my friends; don’t let us quarrel.”.
