country: US.
description: Eric Carucci taps a very cool-climate, biodynamic vineyard originally planted by Syrah legend Bob Lindquist to deliver this tightly wound, age-worthy wine, full of black pepper, tar, violet and dense black currants on the nose. The tart black-plum skins, boysenberry and purple flower notes on the sip need time to develop as do the squeaky tannins, but tons of potential greatness awaits. Drink 2019â€“2029..
