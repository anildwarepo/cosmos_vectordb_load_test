country: US.
description: We can debate the pricing on Yao Ming's new reserve, but what's undeniable, by any modern standard, is the wine's excellence. A blend of fruit from Atlas Peak and Rutherford, the wine is a barrel selection from the winery's regular 2010 output, and accounts for only about 20% of total production. The Cabernet Sauvignon is mixed with a little Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. It's delicious in blackberry, cassis liqueur, dark chocolate and oak flavors, and well structured in acids and tannins. The wine should develop in the bottle for at least 10 years..
