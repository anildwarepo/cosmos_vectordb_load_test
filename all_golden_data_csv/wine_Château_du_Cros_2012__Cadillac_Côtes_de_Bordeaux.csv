country: France.
description: Château du Cros began life in the 12th century, commanding a superb military vantage point over the Garonne river. The surrounding vineyards have produced a fresh and fruity Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon blend with a mineral bite that gives a strong sense of structure. Its weight and a firm texture act as a foil to the juicy red berries and attractive acidity. The wine is almost drinkable now but will be better from 2016..
