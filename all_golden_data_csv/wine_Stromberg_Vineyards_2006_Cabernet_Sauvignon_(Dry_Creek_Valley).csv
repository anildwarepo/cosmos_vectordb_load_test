country: US.
description: Another successful release from Stromberg after the fine 2005 vintage, and it makes the case for Dry Creek Cabernet at its best. Hillside grapes have yielded concentrated flavors of blackberries, plums and spices, and the wine is finely balanced with dense tannins and acidity. Fifty percent new French oak barrel aging is easily absorbed by the wine's inherent size. Elegant and complex, it's a gorgeous wine to drink now..
