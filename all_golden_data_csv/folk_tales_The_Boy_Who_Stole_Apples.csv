title: The Boy Who Stole Apples.
text: An Old Man once found a rude Boy in his Apple Tree and sternly ordered him to come down. The young rogue answered that he would not.“Then I will fetch you down,” said the Old Man. So he threw twigs and bundles of grass up at him, but this only made the young scapegrace laugh.“Very well,” said the Old Man. “If neither words nor grass will bring you down, I will try what virtue there is in stones.” With that he pelted the Boy heartily with stones, which soon brought him down from the tree to beg the Old Man’s pardon..
