country: Austria.
description: Yeasty savoriness on the nose conjures up salty hints of miso and soy, alluringly so. The palate is even more salty and expressive, with waves of tingling white pepper. The fruit that lurks through is of green Conference pear and more greenish savor: think nettle and lovage, even watercress. A lemony fillip provides a fresh backbone. What a joy to drink. Lovely now but built to last. Drink 2017–2025..
