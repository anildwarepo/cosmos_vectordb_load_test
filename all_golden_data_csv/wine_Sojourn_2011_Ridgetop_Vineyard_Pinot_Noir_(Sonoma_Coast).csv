country: US.
description: This Pinot Noir is from the far or “true” Sonoma Coast, near Annapolis, north of the new Fort Ross-Seaview appellation. It shows its origin in the brisk acidity and delicacy of mouthfeel, as well as the fantastic range of wild red berry, cola, pine, nettle and white pepper flavors that change from second to second. New oak brings toasty, vanilla complexities and wood tannins. This is a delicious wine now, but will age gracefully for at least eight years..
