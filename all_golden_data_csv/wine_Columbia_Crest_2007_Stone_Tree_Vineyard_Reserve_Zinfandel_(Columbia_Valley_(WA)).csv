country: US.
description: Columbia Crest makes a limited number of single vineyard reserves. This Zinfandel comes from what is emerging as the best site for that grape in Washington. Bright, tart, and full of sappy raspberry and red fruits, this young, ageworthy Zin has great penetration and punch. In style, it is closest to classic Dry Creek Zins from such producers as A. Rafanelli and Doug Nalle. Though labeled simply Columbia Valley, it's actually the Wahluke Slope AVA..
