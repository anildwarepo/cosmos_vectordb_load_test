description: Ripe del Falco is a successful experiment in the aging ability of Gaglioppo, a native variety of Calabria in Southern Italy. The light-bodied, crimson-colored wine shows tertiary aromas of spicy dried fruit, red licorice and wild mushroom. Not everyone will like it, but if you fancy yourself an enological archeologist, give it a try: The tannins are fine-grained and the delicate wine has aged well over the years..
