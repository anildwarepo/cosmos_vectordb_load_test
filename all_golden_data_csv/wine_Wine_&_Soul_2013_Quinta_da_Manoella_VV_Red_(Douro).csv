country: Portugal.
description: This is a seriously good wine, produced from a field blend of 100-year-old vines. It is concentrated and full of black plum fruit flavors. It brings out the heat of the Pinh√£o valley and also its wonderful structure. The one small downside is that the alcohol does show at this stage in a raw edge. Hopefully this will pass as it matures, because the wine will certainly not be ready to drink before 2020..
