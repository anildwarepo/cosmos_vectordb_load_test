title: The Lion, the Mouse and the Fox.
text: A Lion was lying asleep at the mouth of his den when a Mouse ran over his back and tickled him so that he woke up with a start and began looking about everywhere to see what it was that had disturbed him. A Fox, who was looking on, thought he would have a joke at the expense of the Lion; so he said, “Well, this is the first time I’ve seen a Lion afraid of a Mouse.” “Afraid of a Mouse?” said the Lion testily: “not I! It’s his bad manners I can’t stand.”.
