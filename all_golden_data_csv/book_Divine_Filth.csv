Description: Divine Filth is a collection of long-overlooked erotic prose and scatological fragments rivaled only by Bataille's most well know work, Story of the Eye, for pure 'pornographic' content that transcends the limits of literature and the self. These are shattered mystic visions of a seminal Surrealist with a deep thirst for negation of consciousness through ecstasy, humiliation, depravity and pain. Comprised of two parts, 'Filthy' describes a descent into the scummy underworld of London's nightlife, while 'Divinity' describes drinking to excess and S&M pleasure..
