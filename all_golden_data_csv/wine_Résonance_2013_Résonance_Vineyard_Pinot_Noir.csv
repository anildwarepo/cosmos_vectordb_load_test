description: The eagerly anticipated first release from Maison Louis Jadot's Oregon project does not disappoint. Long time Jadot winemaker Jacques Lardière has put all his heart and expertise into this wine, sourced from a much-loved vineyard recently acquired by the firm. Concentrated raspberry purée comes through in both aroma and flavor, with laser focus. It's a magical combination of finesse, silkiness and strident youth, with 20 years of aging potential. Drink now through 2035..
