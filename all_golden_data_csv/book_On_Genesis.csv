Description: In 1990, New City Press, in conjunction with the Augustinian Heritage Institute, began the project knows as: The Works of Saint Augustine, A Translation for the 21st Century. The plan is to translate and publish all 132 works of Saint Augustine, his entire corpus into modern English. This represents the first time in which The Works of Saint Augustine will all be translated into English. Many existing translations were often archaic or faulty, and the scholarship was outdated. New City Press is proud to offer the best modern translations available. The Works of Saint Augustine, A Translation for the 21st Century will be translated into 49 published books. To date, 41 books have been published by NCP containing 93 of The Works of Saint Augustine, A Translation for the 21st Century. Augustine's writings are useful to anyone interested in patristics, church history, theology and Western civilization. -- Publisher..
