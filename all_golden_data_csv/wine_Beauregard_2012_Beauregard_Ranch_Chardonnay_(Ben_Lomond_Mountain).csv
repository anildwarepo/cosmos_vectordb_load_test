country: US.
description: Ben Lomond is a newish appellation in the cooler, western part the Santa Cruz Mountains (the eastern part favors Cabernet Sauvignon). And by the evidence of this luscious wine, it's a great place for Chardonnay. With plenty of winemaker bells and whistles, it's rich and complex, showing tropical fruit, tangerine, lemon custard, honey, buttered toast and cinnamon flavors, brightened with mouthwatering acidity..
