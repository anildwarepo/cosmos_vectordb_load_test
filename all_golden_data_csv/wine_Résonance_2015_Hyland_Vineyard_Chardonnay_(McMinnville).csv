description: If anyone can elevate Oregon's already excellent Chardonnays to the next level, it's Jacques Lardière, who makes Résonance for Louis Jadot after four decades at their winery in Burgundy. This nutty toasty chiseled wine has impeccable breeding, power and elegance. White peach, pear and apple fruit is wrapped in lush barrel flavors of caramel, buttered toast and vanilla wafer, with firm acids for a foundation. Drink now and on through 2025..
