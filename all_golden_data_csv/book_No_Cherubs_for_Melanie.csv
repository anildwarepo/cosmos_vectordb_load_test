Description: Melanie Gordonstone, a cherubic six-year-old, was Daddy's favourite in every way, but her life ended tragically when she drowned in a backyard pond. Inexperience led young English detective David Bliss to attribute the girl's death to an accident, but since that time he has been haunted by doubts about his original conclusion. Now, more than twenty years later, Melanie's father has died, and toxicology reports indicate that he was murdered. Bliss begins to suspect Melanie's sister, Margaret, who lives in a remote community in northern Ontario. But could Margaret have killed her father from half a world away? Bliss's unauthorized investigation brings him overseas to Canada in search of Margaret - and answers. As he gets closer to the truth, he uncovers the disturbing secrets that have destroyed the Gordonstone family..
