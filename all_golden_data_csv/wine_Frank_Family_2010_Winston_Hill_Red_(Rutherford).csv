country: US.
description: As rich as this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend is, and it is extraordinarily rich, there's something standard about it. It's as though the ripeness of the fruit has obliterated any trace of terroir. Offers a fantastically sweet explosion of blackberries, cherries, plums and chocolate, alongside caramelized, butterscotchy oak, but beyond the sheer power, the wine isn't displaying much subtlety. Hard to tell where it's going, if anywhere..
