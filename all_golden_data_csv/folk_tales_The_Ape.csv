title: The Ape.
text: There is an ape in Paris,To which was given a wife:Like many a one that marries,This ape, in brutal strife,Soon beat her out of life.Their infant cries,—perhaps not fed,—But cries, I ween, in vain;The father laughs: his wife is dead,And he has other loves again,Which he will also beat, I think,—Return’d from tavern drown’d in drink.For aught that’s good, you need not lookAmong the imitative tribe;A monkey be it, or what makes a book—The worse, I deem—the aping scribe..
