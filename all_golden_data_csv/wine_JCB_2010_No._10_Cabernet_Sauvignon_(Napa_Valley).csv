country: US.
description: The word massive barely begins to describe this Cabernet Sauvignon. It aims to compete with anything from Napa Valley, and does so largely successfully. The palate offers waves of ripe blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate and smoky oak flavors. What's harder to put into words is the elegance and balance. Despite its serious heft, the wine feels comfortable in the mouth. Indisputably an ager, it should begin to mellow after 2018, and continue to offer pleasure for many years..
