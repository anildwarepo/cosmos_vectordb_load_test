wine_Domaine_Barmès-Buecher_2014_Rosenberg_Gewurztraminer_(Alsace),"Unnamed: 0: 46102.
country: France.
description: The exquisitely restrained nose has just a touch of honeysuckle perfume—just a hint of that spicy headiness. These aromas also color the fine, ripe and juicy peach fruit on the palate that vies with fine citrus zestiness for attention. Slight residual sweetness caresses the fruit on the palate but this is very subtly done. The finish is off dry, but utterly balanced. This is a very beautiful, elegant and fresh Gewurztraminer. Drink now through 2030..
