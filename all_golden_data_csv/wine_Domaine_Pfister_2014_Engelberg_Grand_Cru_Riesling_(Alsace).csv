country: France.
description: The nose is rather restrained but the palate comes alive with ripe lemon and zesty tangerine. This is dry and concentrated, with a lovely vein of lemon freshness that pervades and brightens the entire experience. Prepare to be refreshed. This is luminous, fresh and so illustrative of the 2014 vintage: A challenge that yielded such jewels in the right hands. Lovely now but with ample mileage. Drink 2017–2037.
