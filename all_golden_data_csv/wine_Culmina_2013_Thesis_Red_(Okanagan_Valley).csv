country: Canada.
description: This Bordeaux-style blend may strike those unfamiliar with Okanagan reds as tilting toward an astringent, tannic style, which many of these wines do. That said, it's complex and compelling, with an array of dried herbs, dried tobacco, dried fruits (cranberries and cherries) and dark chocolate. The granular tannins are ripe and supportive, with a finishing lick of espresso. It's best to decant this for a couple of hours before drinking..
