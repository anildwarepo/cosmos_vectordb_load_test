country: US.
description: One of a pair of single-vineyard, reserve-level Chardonnays, this seamlessly pulls together yellow apple, lemon panna cotta, white pepper and a suggestion of wet rock. Located in the Chehalem Mountains AVA, Aurora fruit is fermented with wild yeast all the way through malolactic, and aged in one-third new and two-thirds neutral French oak. The wild yeast adds detail and texture, and the wine makes a soft, buttery, graceful, prolonged exit..
