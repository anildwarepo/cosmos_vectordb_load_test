.
Description: How can a New Englander love Manhattan over New England clam chowder? Because I like to taste the clams, not just heavy cream with lumps. I came up with this recipe today using what I had on hand, but feel free to improvise. This tastes just like the chowder you get at the beach with clam cakes! Use a food chopper to minimize prep time..
.
Ingredients:.
- 1 (46 fluid ounce) can clam juice.
- 1 (10 ounce) can whole baby clams, drained and juice reserved.
- 2 onions, chopped.
- 3 large carrots, chopped.
- 3 large potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes.
- 1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed tomato soup.
- 1 (6.5 ounce) can tomato sauce.
- 2 tablespoons dried parsley.
- ground black pepper to taste.
.
Instructions:.
- Pour clam juice, and the juice from the canned clams into a large pot. Bring to a boil. Add onion, carrots, and potatoes; and simmer over medium heat for 15 minutes, or until tender. Stir in the tomato soup and tomato sauce, and season with parsley and black pepper. Add clams last, and cook just until heated through..
