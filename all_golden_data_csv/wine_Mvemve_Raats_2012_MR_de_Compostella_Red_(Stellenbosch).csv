country: South Africa.
description: A blend of 28% Cabernet Franc, 23% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Malbec, 18% Petit Verdot and 10% Merlot, this is a big, bold and powerful wine, with superb balance and a firm, concentrated structure that promises great long-term aging. Dense aromas and flavors of blackberry, boysenberry, cherry and fig are layered with notes of cocoa powder, roasted espresso bean and cigar tobacco. Ripe, rich and lush, but not overdone, hints of charred oak and black pepper linger on the finish. Drink 2018â€“2025..
