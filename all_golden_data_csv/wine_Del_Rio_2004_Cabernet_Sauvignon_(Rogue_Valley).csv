country: US.
description: This unusual and quite distinctive Cabernet Sauvignon makes a strong case for the specificity of the Rogue Valley in relation to this international grape. Pungently herbal, yet neither stemmy nor vegetal, this lights up the nose with penetrating, resinous scents. In the mouth it's mostly reminiscent of high altitude Argentine wines—rock, acid, spice and red currant—a product, no doubt of the 1200 foot vineyard site, which is littered with river rock..
