country: US.
description: These vines were planted in 1984; they are dry-farmed with all-natural acids, most unusual for Washington State. So you have a beguiling mix of aromatic, lightly soapy, perfumed, floral scents, matched to exotic passion fruit and grapefruity citrus. There is a lot of acid here, and it's a young wine, but it has wonderful concentration and a full-throttle mix of perfume, fruit and flesh. The finish seems endless, and promises a long life ahead..
