country: Israel.
description: Like the Petit Castel, this wine needs some time to truly open up and express itself, so be sure to give it time to breathe before serving. Medium weight but full in the mouth with firm tannins and a tight structure, the core of black fruit flavors are augmented by hints of tobacco, licorice root and woody spice. Black cherry skins and espresso-infused chocolate appear first on the long finish, followed by wonderfully fresh and invigorating mint..
