Yep, the audio worked, but somehow, increasing and decreasing the volume did not work, making it impossible to listen when people where talking around me or in rooms with background music. That and, even if you download everything, you cannot listen to the audio when offline. Worked just fine, downloaded from home. Just download at your house and you should be fine. The audio tours are a little long-winded but they're nice, free, and informative. cannot download the app on the wifi provided. the difference between art and reality, imagination and function. Hopeless. Couldn't connect..
