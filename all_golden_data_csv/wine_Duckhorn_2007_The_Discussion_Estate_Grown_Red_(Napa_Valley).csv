country: US.
description: Duckhorn's new releases are so good, you might hesitate to make the investment on this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend. True, it's not the most drinkable of their wines, at this time, but it easily is the most intense and concentrated. Dazzles with a molten core of sweet blackberries, blueberries and cassis, deep and long in the finish. Don't insult it by drinking before 2013, but you're better served by holding for far longer, even into the 2020s..
