country: US.
description: Richer and denser than Mayo’s Sangiacomo bottling, this one also seems more marked by oak, with vanilla, menthol and toast aromas all riding over black cherries. In the mouth, the fruit really comes forward; there’s impressive depth and body here, and a lushness that’s balanced by a long finish with fresh acidity. Should age for up to 5 years—maybe more. Only problem? Finding some. There were only 100 cases produced..
