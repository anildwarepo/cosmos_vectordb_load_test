country: US.
description: There's not a great quantity of Pinot Noir in Long Island, but McCall's is consistently one of the region's best producers of it. The Hillside Corchaug Estate is particularly refined, offering loads of ripe cherry and berry flavors calibrated neatly by zesty acidity and savory herb and smoke notes. It's supple and mouth-filling, finishing on a long, delicately tannic note. Drinks well now but should hold nicely through 2025..
