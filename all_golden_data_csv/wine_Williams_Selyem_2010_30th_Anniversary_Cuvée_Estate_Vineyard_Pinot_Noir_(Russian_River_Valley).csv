description: This is a Pinot Noir of considerable force. Your first impression is of irrepressible power, with masses of fruit punching through an overlay of tannin and oak. Then the flavors fantail out, suggesting cherries, cola, currants and spices that are rich and complex through the long finish. For all its richness, the wine retains an agreeable delicacy of texture. Comprised of lots selected by winemaker Bob Cabral for this anniversary bottling, it's right up there with Williams Selyem's best 2010 Pinots, and just as ageable. Drink now–2022. The wine is only available as part of a two-pack from the winery for $250; the other bottle is the 2010 Morning Dew Ranch Pinot Noir, from Anderson Valley..
