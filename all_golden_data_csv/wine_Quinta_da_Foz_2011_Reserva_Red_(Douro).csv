country: Portugal.
description: Powerful tannins are still at work in this structured and dense wine. Produced from grapes that were foot trodden in open fermenters, this wine shows considerable richness and dark plum and damson flavors. Spice and licorice add depth, while ample acidity and the firm texture suggests a considerable future. The wine comes from the Foz Vineyard at the mouth of the Pinh√£o river in the heart of the Douro. Drink from 2017..
