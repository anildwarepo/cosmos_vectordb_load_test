country: US.
description: Incredibly pure and pristine on the nose, notes of citrus cream, sea spray and white flowers hover over a base of white peach in this northern Michigan Chardonnay. With two years in French oak (25% new) and extended lees aging, the palate is round and sultry, boasting lightly brûléed lemon and zesty mineral notes that build to toasted hazelnut. A preserved-lemon finish lingers and leaves the palate wanting more. In time, the acidity will soften and this wine will truly sing. Drink now–2018..
