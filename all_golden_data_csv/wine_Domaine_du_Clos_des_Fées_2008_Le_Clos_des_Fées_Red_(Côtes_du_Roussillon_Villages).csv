country: France.
description: This is a stunning selection, with layers of aromas and flavors that unfold with each passing moment. Concentrated primary notes of blackberry, plum and boysenberry lead, with accents of sweet spice, licorice, soft char, tobacco leaf and menthol following shortly after. The palate is intense and lush, with a full weight and a gripping, thick texture. Hints of oaky spice and cocoa powder linger through the endless finish. Delicious now, but should continue to develop well through 2018..
