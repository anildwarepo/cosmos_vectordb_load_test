description: This very fine Cabernet wants a little time in the cellar. Right now, it's tight in tannins, with some acidic bitterness in the finish. The flavors are of black currants and smoky new oak. The Morisoli Vineyard has been home to very good, ageable bottlings from the likes of Sequoia Grove and Elyse, but in the last few years, Meander has expressed its terroir best. Try after 2012.This very fine Cabernet wants a little time in the cellar. Right now, it's tight in tannins, with some acidic bitterness in the finish.
