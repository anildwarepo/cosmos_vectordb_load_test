Description: Carol Shields' The Stone Diaries irrevocably transformed our understanding of the art of storytelling-and won Shields the Pulitzer Prize in Literature. Artfully disguised as a novel masquerading as the autobiography of an ordinary woman, this seductively written tale gradually reveals itself to be a profound meditation on fact, fiction, and the vast, blurred territory that lies between.
