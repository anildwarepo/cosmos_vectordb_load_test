country: US.
description: Firm in tannins, mouthwatering in acids, and bone dry, this is a wine to hold for a while. The vineyard consistently yields rich, complex Pinots from various wineries, and Siduri again captures its essence as they have for many years. The wine, which is one of Siduri's ripest, shows wild forest cherry, raspberry, cola and spice flavors, with a feral quality suggesting grilled wild mushrooms and balsam. Give it 2â€“3 years..
