description: This wine is a blend of 68% Cabernet Sauvignon, a whopping 23% Petit Verdot, 7% Merlot and 2% Cabernet Franc. The aromas leap up from the glass, with notes of garden herb, tar, black cherry and licorice. The flavors are rich and saturated, loaded with black-fruit notes that persist effortlessly on the finish. It shows a fine sense of structure and balance along with a compelling texture.
