description: You could use this as a teaching tool for classic Sonoma County Zinfandel. It's full-bodied, dry and spicy, with briary flavors of wild berries, mocha, tobacco, leather and exotic spices. More importantly, it's absolutely delicious. The grapes come from Seghesio's best vineyards in the Alexander and Dry Creek valleys. At this price, it's an astonishing value, especially considering that production was nearly 80,000 cases..
