wine_Proprietà_Sperino_2011__Lessona,"Unnamed: 0: 109842.
country: Italy.
description: Tilled earth, underbrush, rose petal, perfumed berry, aromatic herb and a balsamic note are some of the many alluring scents you'll find on this gorgeous red. The juicy palate is both earthy and loaded with finesse, doling out ripe dark cherry, raspberry, pipe tobacco, licorice and energizing mineral. Firm, polished tannins provide structure. It's already almost accessible but will continue to evolve and age beautifully. Drink from 2019 through 2029..
