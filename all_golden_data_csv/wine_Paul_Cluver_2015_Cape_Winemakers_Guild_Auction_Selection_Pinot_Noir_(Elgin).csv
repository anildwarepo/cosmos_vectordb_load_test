country: South Africa.
description: Winemaker: Andries Burger. There's a very fine balance in this attractive Pinot, offering both ripe red-cherry and forest-berry fruits that are graced with hits of bittersweet cocoa, cola spice and forest floor. It's silky and seductive, with well-integrated tannins and ample acidity to keep the palate fresh. Pleasant notes of earthy baking spice and cherry pit carry on through the close. An elegant and refined wine, this should age well through 2023..
