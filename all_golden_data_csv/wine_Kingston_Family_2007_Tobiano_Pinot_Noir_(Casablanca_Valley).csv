country: Chile.
description: Dark purple in color, and very rich on the nose. There's also balancing tart aromatics of rhubarb and bramble. Looks, smells and tastes like a New World/California style of Pinot Noir. It's creamy and oaky in the mouth, but behind that there's ripe, varietal flavors that grow on you as the wine airs out. Maybe too big and brawny for fans of elegant PNs, but plenty good if you like a full-bodied modern wine..
