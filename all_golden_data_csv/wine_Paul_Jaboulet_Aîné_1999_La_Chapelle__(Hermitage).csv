wine_Paul_Jaboulet_Aîné_1999_La_Chapelle__(Hermitage),"Unnamed: 0: 100016.
country: France.
description: Jaboulet's view of its most famous wine seems to have changed. Although the concentrated, dense tannins and big black fruit flavors are still there, it has lost the huge brooding presence of past vintages, and now has a veneer of sophistication with superripe fruit, plums and dark jam tastes. Whether this 1999 will age as well as older vintages remains to be seen, but it will certainly be ready to drink sooner..
