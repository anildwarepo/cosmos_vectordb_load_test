country: Australia.
description: Perhaps the best young wine I've tasted from Margaret River, this makes a compelling case for the region's Cabernet. Pure cassis fruit is lifted and framed by hints of toasted cedar, making for soaring aromatics and flavors, but what sets this wine apart is the tender, silky texture married to ample weight and richness. The finish lingers, with a supple, dreamy character that speaks to a gentle climate and careful winemaking. Drink nowâ€“2030..
