wine_El_Nido_2012_Red_(Jumilla),"Unnamed: 0: 105463.
country: Spain.
description: Giant out of the blocks, this full-bodied, midnight-black bruiser delivers a heavy blast of graphite, vanilla, coconut, char and blackberry on the nose. A heavy, tannic, borderline syrupy palate is appropriate for flavors of toasted coconut, vanilla and oak. A chocolaty finish loaded with barrel resin is rich and heady. This is an extracted heavyweight from a warm year. Some will love it; others will find it too oaky and overripe. Drink through 2021..
