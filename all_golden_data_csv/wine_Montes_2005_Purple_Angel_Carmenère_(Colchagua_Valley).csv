country: Chile.
description: Chile's first high-profile, high-priced Carmenère has proven itself to be an excellent wine. The '05 has a slight herbal DNA, but there's plenty of oak, vanilla, raw fruit and texture to cover that up. On the palate, blackberry, prune and fine herbs comprise the flavors, while the finish turns thick and dense. With 8% Petit Verdot, Purple Angel continues to press the case for high-end Chilean Carmenère..
