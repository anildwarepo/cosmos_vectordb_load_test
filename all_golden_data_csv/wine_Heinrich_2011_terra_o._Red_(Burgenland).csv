wine_Heinrich_2011_terra_o._Red_(Burgenland),"Unnamed: 0: 100281.
country: Austria.
description: A roasted rich note of espresso and grilled pumpkin appears first. The palate is still dense with rich dark-berry fruit. This is full bodied but pervaded by freshness. The finely woven tannin structure is still very firm, very grippy, even though the fruit underneath it begins to show. This is now five years old and has barely begun its trajectory. Lovely now if you like full-bodied wines. Drink now through 2030..
