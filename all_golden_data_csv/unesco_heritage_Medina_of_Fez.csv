short_description: <p>Founded in the 9th century and home to the oldest university in the world, Fez reached its height in the 13th&ndash;14th centuries under the Marinids, when it replaced Marrakesh as the capital of the kingdom. The urban fabric and the principal monuments in the medina &ndash; <em>madrasas, fondouks</em>, palaces, residences, mosques and fountains - date from this period. Although the political capital of Morocco was transferred to Rabat in 1912, Fez has retained its status as the country's cultural and spiritual centre.</p>.
