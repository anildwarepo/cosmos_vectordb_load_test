country: US.
description: . A delightfully intriguing “White Burgundy” blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Blanc and Pinot Meunier, the last an unexpected surprise, the fruit sourced from both the Sangiacomo and Yountmill vineyards. The wine is light and yet lush, with an inviting nose of sweet apricot and apple pie, and a roundness to the mouthfeel. This would pair nicely with a buttery halibut but also stand well on its own as an apéritif..
