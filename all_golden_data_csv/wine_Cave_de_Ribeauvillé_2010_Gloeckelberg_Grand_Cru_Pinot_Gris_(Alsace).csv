country: France.
description: The nose already promises both texture and ripeness with its combined aroma of russet pear peel and juicy pear flesh. The palate only adds to the juicy richness with a good dollop of residual sweetness, boosting all of the pear fruit. This is countered by wonderful lemon drop freshness. The plump but shapely palate is utterly concentrated and aromas of candle wax and honeycomb show that this has just begun to evolve. While the finish has distinct sweetness, it is balanced by 2010's glorious freshness. Lovely now, especially alongside cheese or hot Asian spice, but sure to develop further. Drink 2017–2030..
