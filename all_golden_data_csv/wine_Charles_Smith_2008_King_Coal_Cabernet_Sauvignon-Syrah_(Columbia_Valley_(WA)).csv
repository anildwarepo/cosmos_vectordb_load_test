country: US.
description: This is the first time a King Coal has been made, all sourced from the Stoneridge Vineyard. It's a unique and delicious wine, seamless and complex. The flavors are amazingly detailed, with layer upon layer of candied fruit, raisins, Bourbon barrel, Asian spice, ginger, toast and more. The flavors pile on and continue into a seemingly endless finish, resonating into a spicy blend of fruit and Christmas cookies..
