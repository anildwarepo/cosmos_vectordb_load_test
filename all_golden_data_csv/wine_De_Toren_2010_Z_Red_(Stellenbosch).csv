wine_De_Toren_2010_Z_Red_(Stellenbosch),"Unnamed: 0: 80674.
country: South Africa.
description: De Toren's Merlot-based Bordeaux-style blend also includes 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Cabernet Franc, 12% Malbec and 4% Petit Verdot. It leads with earthy aromas of black-currant leaf, fresh tobacco and menthol that support the black-fruit core of plum, cherry and fig. The palate is full and round, but with enough tannic structure to keep it from feeling too rich or opulent. A toasty cocoa accent lingers long on the close. Drink nowâ€“2017..
