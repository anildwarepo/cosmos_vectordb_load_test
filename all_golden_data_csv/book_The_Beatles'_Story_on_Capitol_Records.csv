Description: ""The Beatles'Story on Capitol Records, Part Two: The Albums"" is the second volume of Bruce Spizer's epic Capitol project. The book opens in 1964 with the release of ""Meet The Beatles!"" and moves forward through 1967's ""Magical Mystery Tour."" Here is the real story behind the Capitol LPs, with explanations of why Capitol reconfigured the Beatles albums for the American market. For each album, the book provides session and chart information and pictures of the front and back covers, all label variations, trade advertisements, promotional posters and displays. The book offers the most comprehensive coverage ever on the infamous butcher cover to the ""Yesterday And Today"" album, which was judged so offensive that it had to be recalled and destroyed. It also provides full details regarding the recording and marketing of ""Sgt, Pepper's Lonely Harts Club Band."" Also included are chapters on the albums issued by Capitol's Canadian and Mexican subsidiaries and a complete breakdown on the stereo, duophonic and mono mixes used by Capitol. Contains over 600 color and original black & white images..
