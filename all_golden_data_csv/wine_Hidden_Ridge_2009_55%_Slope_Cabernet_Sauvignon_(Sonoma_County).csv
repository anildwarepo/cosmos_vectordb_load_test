country: US.
description: This wine tests the critic's judgment. Is it just a fruit bomb, bursting with cherries, raspberries and blackberries, enhanced with caramelized oak? Or is it a Cab that needs time? All indications suggest the latter. The tannins are thick and hard, courtesy of the vineyard's high altitude in the Mayacamas Mountains, and the acidity is perfect to protect the wine as it evolves in the bottle. Give it until at least 2017..
