country: US.
description: Few winemakers in Santa Barbara County understand better than Bill Wathan how to let the terroir of individual vineyards shine, while still providing consumers with a delicious drinking experience. This bottling shows the juicy, ripe flavors one expects from Dijon clones, with flashy notes of raspberries, cherries and currants. It's balanced in crisp acidity, and there's a tangy, dry minerality. Drink nowâ€“2016..
