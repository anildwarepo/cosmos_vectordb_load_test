country: US.
description: Sestina is the bigger sister to the winery's Gravura; again Cabernet Sauvignon takes front and center, with Merlot (18%) and Cabernet Franc (9%) filling in the rest. 70% of the French oak used was new, and the wine has more toast, smoke and barrel depth than its companion, though less of the luscious red fruit is showing. Espresso, cacao and other dark, roasted flavors wrap around black cherry cola and milk chocolate; the finish thoroughly delicious..
