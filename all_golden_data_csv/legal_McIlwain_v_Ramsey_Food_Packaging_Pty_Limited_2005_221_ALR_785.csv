No further documentation to be discovered. 6 In McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Limited (2005) 221 ALR 785 at 799, paragraph 25 Greenwood J observed as follows: Order 15 r 8 seems to embody the following process. A party dissatisfied with the completeness of discovery by another party might seek to identify either a document or class of document as the focus for an application. That document or class of document must relate to a matter in question in the proceeding. The grounds for a belief that some document or class of documents relating to a matter in question exists can be demonstrated to the court either from the evidence adduced by the applicant for an order or from the nature or circumstances of the case (reflected in the pleadings) or from any document filed in the proceedings. The applicant must then demonstrate that such a document or class of document either may be, or may have been, in the possession, custody or power of a party. Once those matters are demonstrated, the court may order such a party to file an affidavit stating whether that document or any document of that class is or has been in the possession, custody or power of the party. 7 On behalf of Granitgard, it is submitted that a good litmus test of Termicide's failure to address its duties as to discovery appears from a letter from its solicitors dated 27 August 2008. In that letter Termicide's solicitors identified and attached an email which, it was conceded, had been the subject of a claim for privilege, and which, it was conceded, ought not to have been subject to such a claim. The email concerned had two enclosures. When they were sought by Granitgard, the response made by the solicitors for Termicide was that: Both of the documents referred to in that email are available in the material provided by the subpoenaed parties. 8 Whilst that particular response might, with all due respect, be regarded as churlish, it does not at all follow that the further disclosure of the email, which, upon reflection, was regarded as not attracting a claim on behalf of Termicide for legal professional privilege, is in any way indicative a failure to observe discovery obligations. To the contrary, it shows an attention to the ongoing responsibilities that attend such an obligation. 9 To use the litmus test analogy favoured by Granitgard, it seems to me, on the material, that Granitgard's application is motivated by an unfortunate acidity in relations not just between the parties but between those who represent them, whereas, on a more objective analysis, the fact of voluntary further disclosure is alkaline in its character. By that I mean there is a quite benign view that one can take of that, which is that of a party, by its solicitors, taking care to observe a discovery obligation notwithstanding a position earlier taken and as soon as it is realised that that earlier position was taken in error. The discovery that was ordered by me on 15 February 2008 was by categories, not general. It is quite apparent from the letter sent in response to Granitgard's letter of 30 April 2008 that there has been reflective consideration by Termicide and those advising it of the adequacy of discovery in respect of the categories of discovery ordered. Having regard to the responses which were made and usefully summarised in the table, it seems to me that there ought not to be any order for further discovery. That is so even if, perchance, strictly, some of the documents identified in the 29 types or categories of document might have at one stage or another existed. 10 Further, I do not see any particular utility in requiring Termicide to verify on oath that which its solicitors have made on its behalf by way of response in that table. The response seems to me to be a complete answer to the request that was made. The application for further discovery, in any event, would enliven a discretion and, as I have indicated, even if, strictly, some documents may or may not at one stage have existed within those 29 classes of document, I am not disposed at this stage of the proceedings to order further discovery by Termicide of those on the basis of the material with which I have been provided for the purposes of hearing the application. And that is an alternative position; the primary one being it seemed to me that the responses made were a complete answer. The application for further and better discovery will therefore be dismissed..
