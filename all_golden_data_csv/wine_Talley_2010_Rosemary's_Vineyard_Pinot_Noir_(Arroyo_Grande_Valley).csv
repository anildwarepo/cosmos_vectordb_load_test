country: US.
description: Exceptionally delicious to drink now, this is rich, vibrant and complex. It offers wave after wave of raspberry and cherry pie filling, rose tea, mineral and smoky sandalwood flavors, which are all wrapped into an incredibly fine texture of complex tannins and vibrant acids. The finish is dry and graceful. It's tough to keep your hands off of this wine, but it should hold in the bottle for 6â€“8 years, gradually losing fruit and gaining earthy, mushroomy complexities..
