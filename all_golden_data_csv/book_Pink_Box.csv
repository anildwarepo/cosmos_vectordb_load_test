Description: In Pink Box, photographer Joan Sinclair gives us a privileged view into Japan's most elaborate sex clubs. Unrivalled in their creativity and the sheer number of choices, these clubs offer their clientele every fantasy imaginable. Subway groping, video and comic book character encounters and visits to the nurse are just the beginning of the immense list of possibilities that are played out in colourful playrooms for adults where no detail is overlooked. Sinclair's photographs are colourful, fun and absolutely absorbing, and they capture the unique sensibility of Japanese culture that has given rise to Hello Kitty (who, by the way, is available for $800 an hour)..
