short_description: <p>Located in the historic centre of Isfahan, the Masjed-e Jām&eacute; (&lsquo;Friday mosque&rsquo;) can be seen as a stunning illustration of the evolution of mosque architecture over twelve centuries, starting in ad&nbsp;841. It is the oldest preserved edifice of its type in Iran and a prototype for later mosque designs throughout Central Asia. The complex, covering more than 20,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>, is also the first Islamic building that adapted the four-courtyard layout of Sassanid palaces to Islamic religious architecture. Its double-shelled ribbed domes represent an architectural innovation that inspired builders throughout the region. The site also features remarkable decorative details representative of stylistic developments over more than a thousand years of Islamic art.</p>.
