wine_Jenke_2002_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Barossa),"Unnamed: 0: 56454.
country: Australia.
description: This wine is much more convincing than Jenke's 2005 Cabernet, reinforcing the concept that Barossa Cab typically performs better in cooler years (2002 was the coolest on record). It's still broad and mouthfilling, but the plum and cassis flavors stay this side of overripe, buttressed by plenty of smoke, vanilla and spice. Long and savory on the finish. Drink nowâ€“2015. Imported by 34th Parallel, LLC..
