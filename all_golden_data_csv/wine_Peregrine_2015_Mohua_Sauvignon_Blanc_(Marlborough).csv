wine_Peregrine_2015_Mohua_Sauvignon_Blanc_(Marlborough),"Unnamed: 0: 73934.
country: New Zealand.
description: This wine starts on the shy side but with several minutes in glass reveals delicate notes of lemon-lime, watermelon rind and grass along with a touch of butter in the background. It's the palate that's of real interest here. Prickly acidity is backed up with a chalky texture, a hint of spice, and a long lemony finish. This is a light and refreshing drop, with a hint of seriousness thrown in for good measure..
