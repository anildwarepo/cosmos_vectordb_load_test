country: US.
description: Huge, rich and flamboyant, this hasa sweetness at its coreâ€”like the essence of red and black currants, with an elaborate note of caramel imparted from smoky oak. Yet everything about it is utterly and properly dry. The vineyard is in St. Helena, not quite in the Spring Mountain appellation, yet showing the fruit concentration firm tannins of mountain-grown grapes. Just a stupendous wine; try after 2016..
