country: US.
description: The color is absolutely black, except for royal purple at the rim of the glass. That just begins to suggest this wine's power. It's saturated in blackberry jam, black currants and chocolate, wrapped into huge tannins. The overall balance is fine, with a squirt of citrusy acidity. This wine defines a well-made California Petite Sirah, with Napa elegance. Fine to drink now with rich beef dishes and cheeses, and will live for decades, gradually shedding tannins and growing finer and sweeter..
