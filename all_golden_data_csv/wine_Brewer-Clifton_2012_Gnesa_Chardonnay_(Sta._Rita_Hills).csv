country: US.
description: Greg Brewer and Steve Clifton's shared vision for this popular grape is distinctive and rather unfamiliar for those seeking a buttery style. This shows chamomile, dandelion greens, Japanese pear and petrol on the nose, with bittery flavors of grapefruit pith, lemon juice and nectarine skins showing first. Patience allows wet wool, stone, sliced apples and white peach elements to emerge. Drink 2017â€“2027..
