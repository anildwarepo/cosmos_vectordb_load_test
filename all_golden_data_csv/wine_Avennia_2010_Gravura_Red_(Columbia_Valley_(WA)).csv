wine_Avennia_2010_Gravura_Red_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 109548.
country: US.
description: The name pays homage to the Graves region of Bordeaux, and the blend of 54% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot and 6% Cabernet Franc also mimics those wines. Here the grapes are sourced from the Red Willow (Yakima Valley), Bacchus (Columbia Basin) and Klipsun (Red Mountain) vineyards. Supple, with beautifully integrated red fruits, and tannins as soft as a kiss, it's masterful winemaking from Chris Peterson, who tended the wines of DeLille for many years..
