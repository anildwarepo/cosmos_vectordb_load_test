country: US.
description: This gigantic Cabernet is not showing well now. The tannins are too strong, the fruit too fresh, sweet and direct in blackberries and cherries, the oak too unintegrated with everything else. It's like a bowl of ingredients that need to be cooked into a recipe. But the structure of tannins and acids is just fine, and while the alcohol is on the high side, the heat it gives is balanced into the overall mouthfeel. Give it 6â€“8 years to begin to come around..
