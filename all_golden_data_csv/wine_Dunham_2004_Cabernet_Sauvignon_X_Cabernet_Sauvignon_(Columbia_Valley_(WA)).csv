wine_Dunham_2004_Cabernet_Sauvignon_X_Cabernet_Sauvignon_(Columbia_Valley_(WA)),"Unnamed: 0: 13452.
country: US.
description: This is all Lewis Vineyard Cabernet, though not as strong as the vineyard-designated bottling from the same vintage. There is noticeable volatility in the opening aromas, which slowly blows off and turns into concentrated raspberry, boysenberry, plum and cherry compote fruit. Dense and buoyed with firm acids, this wine needs a full 24 hours to smooth out. There is plenty of well-managed oak, adding smoky coffee and espresso to the finish..
designation: Cabernet Sauvignon X.

price: 45.0.
