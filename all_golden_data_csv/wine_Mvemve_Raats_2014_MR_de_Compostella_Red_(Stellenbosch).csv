country: South Africa.
description: This blend of 45% Cabernet Franc, 18% Malbec, 17% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Merlot and 7% Petit Verdot opens with attractive green, herbal notes of peppercorn, laurel, blackcurrant leaf and plum skin. Smooth at first, with ripe plum and berry flavors on the palate, the fine tannins offer a pronounced yet dusty grip throughout the long, dry finish. It's a well-balanced wine that should continue to gain complexity through 2022..
