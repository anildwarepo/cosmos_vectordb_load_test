title: The Lion Going to War.
text: The lion had an enterprise in hand;Held a war-council, sent his provost-marshal,And gave the animals a call impartial—Each, in his way, to serve his high command.The elephant should carry on his backThe tools of war, the mighty public pack,And fight in elephantine way and form;The bear should hold himself prepared to storm;The fox all secret stratagems should fix;The monkey should amuse the foe by tricks.“Dismiss,” said one, “the blockhead asses,And hares, too cowardly and fleet.”“No,” said the king; “I use all classes;Without their aid my force were incomplete.The ass shall be our trumpeter, to scareOur enemy. And then the nimble hareOur royal bulletins shall homeward bear.”A monarch provident and wiseWill hold his subjects all of consequence,And know in each what talent lies.There’s nothing useless to a man of sense..
