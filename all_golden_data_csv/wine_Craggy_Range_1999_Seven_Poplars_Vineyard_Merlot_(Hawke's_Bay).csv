country: New Zealand.
description: A big, mouth-filling Merlot, loaded with mocha, black cherries and dried herbs and picking up anise and vanilla notes on the finish. The mouthfeel is special, leaving a creamy coating of tannins behind as the flavors do a slow, delicate fade. Food pairing might be problematic in its youthful baby fatâ€”it's probably best alone or with cheese now, or age it a few years and serve with herb-crusted roasts..
