description: From Marchese Lodovico Antinori's beautiful wine estate in Bibbona, this boasts the heritage of the great super Tuscan family to which it belongs. The blend is Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot, and the overall effect is simply gorgeous. Richness, generosity and persistence characterize the mouthfeel, and the bouquet is driven by aromas of red cherry, chocolate and spice. Drink after 2015..
