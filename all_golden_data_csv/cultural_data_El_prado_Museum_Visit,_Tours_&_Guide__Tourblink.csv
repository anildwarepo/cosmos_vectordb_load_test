First Page Reviews: A waste of money. I bought the 2 hour ""best of the prado"" tour. It had only about 20 pieces and no defined route.

It just provides pictures of the works, which you have to find on your own. Official Prado maps show artist locations only, not individual pieces. The actual information on each piece is short, and the audio is an auto-generated reading of the text. The videos were kind of nice, but they are in Spanish only. Same price you can buy the official Prado audio-guide with a set route.

I managed to follow about 15% until i got lost. Since there is no map of your acual location I spent more time figuring out where i was and where i needed to go or which painting to look at. Waste of money. Could not use it in the Prado Museum at all. All recordings in robot style voices with no set route for the museum... It took ages to locate the art pieces. All these interactive maps are so hard to follow. Definitely not worth the money....
