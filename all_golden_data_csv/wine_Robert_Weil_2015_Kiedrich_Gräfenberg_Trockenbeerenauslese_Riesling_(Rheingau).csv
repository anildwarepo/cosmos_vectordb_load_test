country: Germany.
description: With layers upon layers of spicy saffron, peach, honey and caramel to be enjoyed on the nose alone, this heady botrytized Riesling is pure hedonism. The sweet-tart palate is deft and spry yet deeply lusciously penetrating in flavor. Spine-tingling acidity darts through a honeyed, waxy slick that extends the finish endlessly. It's already a heart-stopping wine but will continue to improve for decades to come..
