country: US.
description: All hand-harvested and hand-sorted, this is a spectacular effort—racy, sharp-edged, showing a steely, stony definition that is rare in the New World. Woodward Canyon wines need time and reward cellaring, but that is not to say that these wines cannot be savored when young. It's just that they will improve dramatically with time. Here are intimations of herb, olive, bark, pepper, tobacco and clove. It's a truly gorgeous wine, rarified and tight..
