description: If the first duty of a wine is to be delicious, this Pinot more than lives up to the obligation. It doesn't show the delicacy or silkiness of a classic Russian River Pinot Noir, being a little heavy and full-bodied. But it's fabulously rich and opulent, offering a tapestry of berry, mocha, spice and smoky oak notes. Soft, smooth tannins and crisp acids add to the pleasure. Drink this over the next few years..
