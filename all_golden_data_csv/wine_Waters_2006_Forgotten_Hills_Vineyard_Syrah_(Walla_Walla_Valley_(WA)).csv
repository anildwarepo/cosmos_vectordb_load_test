country: US.
description: From 10-year-old vines at a vineyard in the foothills of the Blue Mountains east of town, this is a lush and loamy Syrah, smelling and tasting of moist earth, game and blood. There are some roasted tomato flavors along with light red fruits, but this is no wimpy wine; in fact, it gathers strength and concentration as it sits in the mouth, suggesting that it needs more years in the bottle to fully emerge from its shell..
