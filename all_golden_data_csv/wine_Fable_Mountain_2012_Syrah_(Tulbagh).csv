country: South Africa.
description: There's a spicy soul to this beautiful Syrah, as forward notes of white pepper, licorice and sweet spice abound on the nose and mouth, infusing the raspberry, cherry and brambly blackberry fruits throughout. Additional notes of purple violets, fynbos and black tea add depth and interest. Medium weight, the approachable palate boasts a crushed satin texture, with fine yet gripping tannins that hang on through the spicy finish. Drink nowâ€“2020..
