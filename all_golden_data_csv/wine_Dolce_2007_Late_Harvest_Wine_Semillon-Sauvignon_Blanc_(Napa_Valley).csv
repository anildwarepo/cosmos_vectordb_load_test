country: US.
description: Another spectacular Dolce, which continues the brand's string of successes and further emphasizes its standing as one of California's greatest- white dessert wines. It lacks a touch of the concentration found in the 2006, but it dazzles nonetheless with intricate, sweet flavors of honey, butterscotch, golden-apricot nectar, orange marmalade, pineapple tart, vanilla and buttered toast. And all that is brightened by crisp acidity. Terrific to drink now, and it will hold in a proper cellar for a decade. The blend is 82% SÃ©millon and 18% Sauvignon Blanc..
