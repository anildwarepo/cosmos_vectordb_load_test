country: France.
description: There is an interesting mix of grapes here —with Cabernet Sauvignon with Bordeaux origins blended with the local Négrette and with the Syrah more commonly found in the Rhône. Such is the eclectic nature of Southwest France vineyards. The wine itself is mature, soft and fruity, with light tannins and a perfumed edge. The red-plum fruits are juicy, ripe and with an attractive balance of acidity. Drink now..
