country: US.
description: There are three benches at the estate vineyard —west, north and south-facing. This 100% Syrah is a blend of two of them. You get the more earthy Northern Rhône attributes; exotic scents of herb and cured meat—not bacon fat from the barrel but legitimate flavors from the terroir. In 2006 it's tight, edgy and still youthful; this is an ageworthy Syrah that will expand and develop over the next 6–8 years. For the moment, it needs decanting to show its best. After breathing, as the wine opens, new layers of flavor emerge: soy, vanilla, raisin and buttered nuts..
