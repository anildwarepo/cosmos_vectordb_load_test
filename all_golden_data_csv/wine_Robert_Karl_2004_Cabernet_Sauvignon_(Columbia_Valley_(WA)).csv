country: US.
description: Supple and juicy, this young, purple, berry-loaded Cab includes small amounts of the other four Bordeaux grapes in the blend. It's a masterful blending achievement, with each grape seeming to contribute something to the nose, the mouthfeel, the length and the overall focus. Flavors are tightly woven—purple fruits, butterscotch, mocha, moist earth and baking spices—but nothing is overwrought. This will need considerable breathing time to unwrap, and years in the bottle to soften some of the hard edges..
