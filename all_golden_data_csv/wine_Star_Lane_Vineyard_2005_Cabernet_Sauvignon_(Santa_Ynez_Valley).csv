country: US.
description: The Dierberg family worked hard before releasing this Cab, which comes from the warmest part of the appellation. It's quite a good wine, soft and rich and immediately likeable for its array of black currant, licorice and mocha flavors. The 100% new French oak is just right in smoke and cedary vanilla. The next step is to build in layers of density and complexity, but this is a huge step forward for Santa Ynez Valley Cabernet Sauvignon..
