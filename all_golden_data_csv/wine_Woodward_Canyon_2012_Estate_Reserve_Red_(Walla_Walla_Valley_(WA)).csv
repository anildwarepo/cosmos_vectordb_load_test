country: US.
description: This blend is near-equal parts Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon along with a healthy dollop of Petit Verdot (18%). It shows a mix of fruit and savory elements, with notes of potting soil, green coffee bean, mocha, fresh herbs, licorice, generous barrel spices and red and black fruitâ€”showing more with each swirl. The fruit and chocolate flavors are dense and rich, with bright acids and a firm core of tannins. The balance is spot-on and the finish lingers. It drinks beautifully now but you can expect it to age for another 20 years..
