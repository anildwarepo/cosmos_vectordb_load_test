country: Austria.
description: This blend of St. Laurent, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon offers glossy, polished plum fruit that is still closed now, but promises to come to the fore after some cellaring. Great concentration on the midpalate, fresh acidity and finely-woven tannins also bode well for the future of this wine. There is a mineral, gravelly, spicy background that promises more interest and aromatic layers. Ready from 2016..
