country: Italy.
description: Don Anselmo is among Basilicata's most important wines because it does a phenomenal job of highlighting the potential of this volcanic territory and the Aglianico grape. This interpretation focuses on soft, velvety tones of black cherry, graphite and spice that peel off in layers. The wine has a dark, concentrated color followed by great intensity, power and rock-hard tannins that need a few more years of bottle aging..
