Description: The twins graduate-and say goodbye to SVH for good. Elizabeth can't believe she's finally turning 18 and graduating high school. She's been waiting for this moment her entire life. She can't wait to say good-bye to the past and start a new life. And the best part of it all-she gets to do it with her twin sister. But for Jessica, the only thing worse than turning 18 is turning 18 and graduating the same week. What if she's not ready for her entire life to change? And what if it means losing her sister?.
