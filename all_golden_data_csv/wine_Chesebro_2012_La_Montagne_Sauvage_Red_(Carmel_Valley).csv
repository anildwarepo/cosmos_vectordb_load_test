country: US.
description: Bountiful and rich black fruits of black currant and black cherry meet with dark clove and other baking spices as well as a hint of maple on the nose of this Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre blend. The palate's chalky structure is soft, allowing strong spice to rise amidst the black fruit in the midpalate, followed by a wave of plummy purple-flower flavors. The finish is all acid, which makes for a compelling combo of sensations..
