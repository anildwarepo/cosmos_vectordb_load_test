country: US.
description: This atypical blend brings exceptional fruit to the table, with Pinot Noir sourced from the Dundee Hills and Syrah from Walla Walla. Syrah dominates the aromas, with gamy whiffs of smoke, coffee and and licorice. The tangy black-cherry fruit comes with a streak of balsamic and a hint of pine sap. Though Pinot Noir rarely succeeds with other grapes in the blend, this is the exception that proves the rule..
