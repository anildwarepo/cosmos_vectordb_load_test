country: France.
description: Stony, peachy notes are evident on the nose. The palate confirms these and majors on that stony, structural framework. Pervaded as it is by ripe stone fruit flavor of yellow plum and peach, there is a pleasant bitter edge, reminiscent of honey. This is an exciting tightrope walk between the slightest smidgeon of residual sweetness and electric acidity, finishing dry. Ready now, will drink well until 2018..
