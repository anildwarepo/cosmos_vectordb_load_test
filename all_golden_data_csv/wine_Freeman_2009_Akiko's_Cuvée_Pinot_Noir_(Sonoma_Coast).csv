country: US.
description: Showing the art of blending, this small-production Pinot was made from the fruit of six vineyards. It is an exceptional expression of the Sonoma Coast, being translucent in color, dry, silky and crisp in acids. The flavors are complex and delicious, with berries, cherries and persimmons conjoined with mushrooms, spices and new oak. Lovely now, and should develop interestingly over the next 6–8 years..
