wine_Château_Bouscaut_2013__Pessac-Léognan,"Unnamed: 0: 69471.
country: France.
description: While this wine is dark and packed with tannins, it has the fruit weight potential to compensate. It is a firm wine, solid with ripe tannins and blackberry flavors. The acidity at the end promises a good future, so drink from 2022. Lucien Lurton took over Bouscaut in 1979. Since 1992, has been in the hands of daughter Sophie Lurton and her husband Laurent Cogombles. Investments include vineyard renovation, a barrel cellar in 2010 and a B&B in 2013..
