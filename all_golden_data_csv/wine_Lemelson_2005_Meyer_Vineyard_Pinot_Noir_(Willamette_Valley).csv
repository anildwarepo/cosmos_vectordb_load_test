wine_Lemelson_2005_Meyer_Vineyard_Pinot_Noir_(Willamette_Valley),"Unnamed: 0: 28322.
country: US.
description: It opens with sweet/tart raspberry fruit, a streamlined, well-defined wine underscored by tart, citrusy acids. It does not show the harmonious complexity of the blends, but it is a very pleasant wine, soft and approachable, sweet and smooth. A bit one-dimensional; it begins with fresh berry fruit, tosses in a hint of cherry tobacco, and leaves a slightly earthy impression in the finish, but fails to move in the mouth..
