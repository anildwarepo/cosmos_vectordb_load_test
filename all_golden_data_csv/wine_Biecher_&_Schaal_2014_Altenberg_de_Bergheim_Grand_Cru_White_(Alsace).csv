country: France.
description: A rather perfumed nose hints at the Gewurztraminer that colors this Riesling with rose petal and honeysuckle notes. The co-planted varieties in this vineyard make a smashing duo since they are almost polar opposites: structured, straight-laced Riesling with its fine spine of acidity benefits from the playfulness and charm of aromatic, fleshy Gewurztraminer which in turn is lit up by Riesling's freshness. Really, this is a case where you can have the best of both worlds..
