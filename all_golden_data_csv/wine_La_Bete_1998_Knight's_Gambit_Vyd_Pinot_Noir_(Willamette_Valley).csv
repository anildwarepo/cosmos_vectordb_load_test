country: US.
description: Multi-dimensional and inviting, the nose offers a melange of cherry, spice, earth and gamy notes. A very supple mouthfeel follows with wonderfully firm, but not biting, acidity. Dark cherry and oak flavors hang on a handsome frame. Closes with a long, spicy finish with beautifully integrated tannins. Has great character; a most impressive example of the vintage and the Knightâ€™s Gambit and Red Hills Estate Vineyards..
